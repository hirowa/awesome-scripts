## Batch File Executor for Subfolders

### Script Overview
This batch script is designed to recursively search through all subfolders of a specified directory for any `.bat` files and execute them sequentially. This script is particularly useful for automating the process of running multiple batch files located within different subdirectories without manually navigating to each folder.

### Detailed Use/Features
1. **Recursive Search**:
   - The script uses the `for /r` command to search recursively (`/r`) through a specified directory and all of its subdirectories for files with the `.bat` extension.

2. **Change Directory and Execute**:
   - For each `.bat` file found, the script changes the current working directory to the directory containing the batch file.
   - It then uses the `call` command to execute the batch file. The `call` command is used to ensure that control returns to the main script after executing each batch file.

3. **User Notification**:
   - The script starts with an `@echo start` command to notify the user that the script is running.
   - It ends with a `pause` command to keep the command prompt window open, allowing the user to see any messages or output generated by the executed batch files.

### Installation
This script does not require installation and can be run directly on a Windows operating system.

#### Requirements
- Windows operating system (Windows 7 or later)
- Basic understanding of command prompt and batch scripting

#### Installation Steps
1. Open a text editor such as Notepad.
2. Copy and paste the provided batch script code into the editor.
3. Save the file with a `.bat` extension, for example, `RunAllSubfolderScripts.bat`.
4. Place the `.bat` script in the directory from which you want to start the recursive search for other `.bat` files.

#### Usage
1. **Place the Script**: Ensure the script (`RunAllSubfolderScripts.bat`) is placed in the desired starting directory or modify the directory path in the script to point to the desired starting location.
2. **Run the Script**: Double-click the script file (`RunAllSubfolderScripts.bat`) to execute it. The script will search for all `.bat` files in the specified directory and subdirectories, change to the appropriate directories, and execute each batch file found.
3. **Monitor Execution**: The command prompt window will display the progress. After executing all batch files, the window will pause to allow you to review any output or error messages.
