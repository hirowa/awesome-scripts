## Stipple Effect Editor
### Script Overview
This script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for applying a stipple (dot-matrix) effect to grayscale images and exporting the result as an SVG file. The stipple effect simulates shading through the density of small black dots using adaptive thresholding. Users can upload one or more images, adjust stipple density interactively via a slider, and export the output in scalable vector graphics format.

### Detailed Use/Features
1. **Image Uploading**: Allows users to upload one or multiple images in common formats such as PNG, JPEG, BMP, and TIFF.
2. **Stipple Effect Application**: Converts the first uploaded image to grayscale and applies a stippling effect using OpenCV’s adaptive thresholding. The density of stippling can be dynamically adjusted via a slider.
3. **Image Display**: Shows a preview of the stippled image within the GUI using the `Canvas` widget.
4. **SVG Export**: Enables the export of the processed stipple image as an SVG file where each black pixel is replaced with a tiny black circle (radius 1 pixel).
5. **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Tkinter for ease of use, the GUI guides users through each step from image upload to SVG export.

### Installation
#### Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- The following Python packages must be installed:
  - `opencv-python`
  - `numpy`
  - `Pillow`
  - `svgwrite`
  - `tkinter` (usually included with standard Python installations)

#### Installation Steps
1. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed on your machine.
2. Install required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy Pillow svgwrite
   ```
3. Save the script to a `.py` file, for example `stipple_editor.py`.

#### Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python stipple_editor.py
   ```
2. Click the "Upload Image(s)" button to select an image file.
3. Use the "Stipple Density" slider to adjust the stippling intensity.
4. Once satisfied with the result, click "Export as SVG" to save the stippled image as an SVG file.
