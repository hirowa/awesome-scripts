## Advanced Stipple Effect Editor
### Script Overview
The **Advanced Stipple Effect Editor** is a graphical desktop application built with `Tkinter` that enables users to apply stipple and dithering effects to images with real-time previews. Users can load one or multiple images, apply a variety of stippling techniques—including dot-based patterns, shapes, and text-based characters—and export the results as both **SVG** and **PNG** files. The editor supports advanced customization such as brightness, contrast, thresholding, spacing, dot shapes, color picking, and dithering methods like Bayer, Floyd-Steinberg, and Atkinson.
