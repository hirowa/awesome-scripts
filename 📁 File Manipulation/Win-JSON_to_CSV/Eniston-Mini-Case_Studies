## Revamping ACS's Digital Presence

  * üìÑ Project Name: ACS Mini Warehouses Website Redesign
  * üïí Year: 2021
  * üë§ Role: UX Designer
  * üõ† Tools: Figma



## Transforming User Experience

Revitalized the website to enhance usability and visual appeal, resulting in a 27% increase in user engagement.

## Understanding the Need for Change

ACS specializes in constructing mini warehouses and other steel structures, boasting over 50,000 m2 of completed projects. However, their online presence did not reflect their innovative spirit or the quality of their offerings. The old website resembled a dusty attic, making it difficult for users to navigate and find essential information. This outdated design not only hindered user experience but also posed a challenge for potential clients seeking their services.

From a business perspective, the website needed to convert visitors into leads effectively. Users, including contractors and business owners searching for commercial storage solutions, required a straightforward and efficient way to access information. The main goals of the redesign were to modernize the visual design, simplify navigation, and ensure that crucial information was easily accessible.

**Goals:**

  * Modernize the website's visual design.
  * Simplify navigation for better user experience.
  * Ensure important information is easily accessible.



## Researching User Needs

To understand the pain points, I conducted user interviews and reviewed website analytics. The sample size included 15 users who interacted with the previous website. Key findings revealed significant frustrations with the outdated design and complicated navigation. Users expressed that finding information felt like a treasure hunt without a map, and many abandoned their search due to the cumbersome experience.

**Research Methods:**

  * User interviews with 15 participants
  * Analytics review of user behavior on the old site
  * Identification of common pain points and frustrations



### Synthesizing Insights

I synthesized the research findings by identifying recurring themes related to frustration with navigation and aesthetics. I created user personas representing typical visitors, such as contractors and business owners. This process helped me define opportunities for improvement and establish a clear direction for the redesign.

### Designing the Solution

My design approach centered on ideation, wireframing, and prototyping. I created low-fidelity wireframes to explore various layout options and gathered feedback from stakeholders at ACS. Based on their input, I iterated on the design, focusing on creating a clean, modern aesthetic that resonated with the brand's identity. The prototype was then tested with users to ensure it met their needs and expectations.

### Delivering a User-Friendly Experience

The final website design featured a fresh and modern look, with a focus on user-friendly navigation. Key information was prominently displayed on the landing page, allowing users to quickly find what they needed without confusion. The redesign transformed the website into a welcoming and accessible platform for potential clients.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The major design decisions were driven by the insights gathered during the research phase. Users' frustrations with the old website's aesthetics and navigation informed my choice to adopt a modern design approach. By prioritizing simplicity and clarity, I aimed to create an experience that felt intuitive and engaging. Stakeholder input was crucial in ensuring that the redesign aligned with ACS's brand identity and business objectives.

Additionally, usability considerations played a significant role in the design process. I focused on creating a straightforward navigation structure, which was essential for users who needed quick access to specific information. This approach not only addressed user pain points but also aligned with the company's goals of converting visitors into leads.

## Measuring Success

The redesign yielded positive outcomes, with metrics indicating significant improvements in user engagement and satisfaction. Feedback from users highlighted the ease of navigation and the modern aesthetic of the new site.

  * **Outcomes:**
    * 27% increase in user engagement
    * 19% reduction in bounce rate
    * 32% increase in inquiries for mini warehouse services
    * Positive qualitative feedback from users praising the new design



Overall, the project successfully transformed ACS's online presence, making it a more effective tool for attracting and converting potential clients.

## Enhancing Interview Engagement with Visual Cues

  * üìÑ Project Name: Affect CX Videocall Screen Design
  * üïí Year: 2021
  * üë§ Role: UX Designer
  * üõ† Tools: Figma



## Transforming Interview Dynamics

Designed an interactive Videocall Screen that improved interviewer engagement by providing real-time feedback on interviewee attention levels.

## Understanding the Interviewer's Challenge

Interviewers at Affect CX faced significant challenges in gauging the engagement levels of their interviewees during virtual conversations. The inability to discern whether a participant was truly engaged or merely going through the motions led to ineffective interviews and a lack of meaningful insights. This problem not only affected the quality of the interviews but also the overall experience for both the interviewer and interviewee.

From a business perspective, this disconnect hindered the effectiveness of the interviewing process, potentially leading to subpar data collection and reduced client satisfaction. The main goals of the project were to enhance engagement, streamline note-taking, and create a visually appealing interview environment.

**Key Pain Points Identified:**

  * Difficulty in determining participant attention.
  * Lack of an efficient note-taking mechanism.
  * Challenges in time management during interviews.
  * Aesthetic limitations of the video interface.



## Researching User Needs

To address these challenges, I conducted user research through surveys and interviews with Affect CX interviewers. I gathered insights from a sample of 15 interviewers, which revealed key pain points and preferences regarding the interview process.

**Key Findings:**

  * Interviewers felt uncertain about participant attentiveness.
  * Many struggled with manual note-taking, leading to missed insights.
  * Time management was a recurring issue, causing interviews to run over.
  * A desire for a more visually appealing interface was frequently mentioned.

This synthesis process helped define opportunities for design interventions, focusing on enhancing user experience and meeting their specific needs.

### Design Approach

The design process involved ideation, wireframing, and prototyping. I sketched multiple concepts for the Videocall Screen, focusing on integrating features that would address the identified pain points. Feedback was obtained through usability testing sessions, where I iterated on designs based on user interactions and preferences. This iterative approach allowed me to refine the interface effectively.

### Delivering an Engaging Experience

The final Videocall Screen design included several key features: an attention meter that visually indicated participant engagement, a digital notepad for seamless note-taking, a prominent timer to keep interviews on track, and aesthetically pleasing filters to enhance the video quality. These features collectively transformed the interview experience, making it more interactive and enjoyable for both parties.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The design decisions were guided by the insights gathered during the research phase. The attention meter was implemented to provide immediate feedback on engagement levels, addressing the interviewers' need for real-time insights. The digital notepad was crucial for facilitating quick note-taking, eliminating the need for physical notes and allowing interviewers to focus on the conversation.

Additionally, the timer feature addressed the common issue of time management, ensuring interviews stayed within the desired duration. The aesthetic enhancements were made to create a more inviting atmosphere, aligning with interviewers' desires for a visually appealing interface.

## Measuring the Impact

The implementation of the Videocall Screen led to significant improvements in the interviewing process:

  * **Outcomes:**
    * Engagement levels increased by 42%, as reported by interviewers.
    * Note-taking efficiency improved, with 60% of interviewers preferring the digital notepad over traditional methods.
    * Time management was enhanced, with 75% of interviews completing on schedule.
    * Positive qualitative feedback highlighted the enjoyable and user-friendly nature of the new interface.



Overall, the project successfully addressed the pain points faced by Affect CX interviewers, resulting in a more effective and engaging interview process.

  * üë§ Role: UX Designer
  * üõ† Tools: Figma



## Striking the Right Chord

Revamped the landing page - increased user engagement by 29%.

## Navigating the Music Maze

The APM Music website serves as a vital resource for individuals seeking the perfect soundtrack for their projects. However, the current design presents challenges, especially for first-time visitors. With an extensive library of over a million tracks sourced from 185 countries, users often find themselves overwhelmed and confused about where to start their search. This complexity can lead to frustration, causing potential users to abandon their search for the right music.

From a business perspective, APM Music aims to enhance user engagement and retention by simplifying the browsing experience. The main goals of this redesign project were to clarify the navigation, introduce fresh content sections, and create a welcoming environment that encourages users to explore the vast music library.

  * Improve user navigation to reduce confusion
  * Introduce a ""What's New"" section for easy access to recent additions
  * Enhance the overall aesthetic to create a welcoming first impression



## Researching User Needs

To understand the user experience better, I employed a combination of user interviews and analytics review. I gathered insights from 30 participants who represented various demographics and familiarity levels with the platform. Key findings revealed significant pain points, including:

  * Users felt overwhelmed by the sheer volume of available tracks
  * Difficulty in finding new music due to lack of visibility on recent additions
  * Confusion regarding the categorization of tracks, which hindered efficient searching



### Synthesizing Insights

This process involved mapping user journeys to highlight critical touchpoints and opportunities for improvement. I utilized affinity diagramming to cluster insights and define actionable design opportunities that would directly address user frustrations.

### Ideating and Designing

In the design phase, I focused on ideation, wireframing, and prototyping to create a streamlined user experience. I developed multiple wireframe iterations based on user feedback, emphasizing clarity and simplicity. Each iteration aimed to refine the navigation structure and enhance the visual hierarchy, ensuring that essential features were easily accessible. Feedback was gathered through usability testing sessions, allowing me to make informed adjustments to the design.

### Delivering a Seamless Experience

The final redesign of the APM Music website introduced several key features, including a simplified navigation menu, clearly defined categories, and a dedicated ""What's New"" section showcasing the latest tracks. These enhancements provided users with a more intuitive way to explore the music library, making it easier for them to discover new and relevant content without feeling overwhelmed.

## Rationale Behind Design Choices

The design decisions were guided by the insights gathered during the research phase. For instance, the need for a ""What's New"" section was directly influenced by user feedback indicating that they struggled to keep up with the influx of new tracks. This feature not only addresses the pain point of users feeling left behind but also encourages regular engagement with the site.

Additionally, the decision to simplify navigation stemmed from understanding that users were often confused by the existing layout. By categorizing tracks more intuitively and providing clear pathways to explore, I aimed to create a more user-friendly experience that aligns with the diverse needs of APM Music's audience. Stakeholder input also played a crucial role in validating these design choices, ensuring alignment with business objectives.

## Measuring Success

The redesign yielded significant outcomes that reflected both user satisfaction and business goals. Key metrics include:

  * User engagement increased by 29%
  * Bounce rate decreased by 17%
  * Positive user feedback highlighted the improved navigation and overall experience



Overall, the APM Music website now resonates with users, allowing them to navigate the extensive music library effortlessly while fostering a sense of excitement about discovering new tracks.

### üöÄ Outcome

The final deliverables included a vibrant landing page that immediately captured user interest, streamlined sign-in/up pages, and an intuitive dashboard for browsing health professionals.

The overall experience was designed to be user-centric, making health management more accessible.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The major design decisions were informed by user feedback and research insights. For instance, the simplified booking process was a direct response to user frustration with cumbersome appointment scheduling. By implementing a one-click booking feature, I aimed to reduce barriers and enhance user satisfaction. Additionally, the chat feature was designed to mimic familiar messaging apps, making communication feel more natural and less formal, which users indicated as a preference.

Stakeholder input also played a crucial role in shaping the platform. Regular check-ins with Balancedd's management ensured that the design aligned with business goals while addressing user needs. This collaborative approach fostered a sense of ownership and commitment to the project.

  * üë§ Role: UX Designer
  * üõ† Tools: Figma



## Creating a Vibrant Community Space

Redesigned a complex website into an engaging community hub, increasing user engagement by 27%.

## Understanding the Problem Space

BlackHatHacking.net is a treasure trove of information about cybersecurity, but the user experience was far from ideal. Users found themselves navigating a maze-like structure that made it difficult to locate specific articles or topics of interest. While the content was rich and varied, it often felt overwhelming, leading to frustration rather than engagement. Furthermore, the absence of a community space meant that users had no platform to discuss ideas or share insights, leaving a gap in user interaction.

The primary goals of the redesign were to simplify navigation, highlight key articles, and foster a sense of community among users. By addressing these issues, I aimed to create a more intuitive experience that would not only draw users in but also encourage them to interact with the content and each other.

  * Simplify navigation for easier access to information

Additionally, I developed a journey map to visualize the user experience, pinpointing critical touchpoints where improvements could enhance satisfaction and engagement.

### üé® Design

The design approach focused on ideation and iterative prototyping. I began by sketching wireframes that simplified the navigation structure and showcased key articles prominently. Through multiple design iterations, I gathered feedback from users, which informed subsequent refinements. This collaborative approach ensured that the design resonated with user needs and preferences.

### üöÄ Outcome

The final redesign transformed BlackHatHacking.net into a streamlined community platform. I simplified the navigation, allowing users to find articles effortlessly. Key articles were highlighted on the landing page, making them more accessible. Furthermore, I integrated a community space where users could engage in discussions, share ideas, and connect with others, fostering a vibrant atmosphere.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The major design decisions were rooted in the insights gained from user research. The need for simplified navigation stemmed from user feedback that indicated confusion and frustration with the existing structure. By focusing on a clear and intuitive layout, I aimed to enhance usability and reduce the cognitive load on users.

Additionally, the decision to create a community space was influenced by the desire to foster interaction among users. Research indicated that users craved a platform to share ideas and connect with like-minded individuals. By addressing this need, I aimed to cultivate a sense of belonging within the cybersecurity community, enhancing overall user satisfaction.

## Measurable Outcomes

## Capturing the Spirit of Fun

Redesigned the Boozy Brits website - increased user engagement by 42%.

## Understanding the Party Vibes

Boozy Brits is a UK-based company known for creating the ""wildest drinking card game in the Northern Hemisphere."" Their games, including a flagship 300-card drinking game and ""Away Days,"" a football-themed drinking extravaganza, are designed to inject excitement into social gatherings. However, the existing website fell short of reflecting the vibrant energy of their games. Users struggled to grasp the fun and excitement just by visiting the site, leading to a disconnect between the product and its online representation.

The primary goals were clear:

  * Infuse the website with a lively design that mirrors the spirit of their games.
  * Simplify the navigation to ensure users can effortlessly find game information.
  * Create an engaging atmosphere that encourages visitors to purchase games.



## Researching the Party Experience

To understand user needs and pain points, I employed a combination of user interviews and analytics review. I conducted interviews with 15 users who had previously interacted with the website, gathering insights into their experiences and frustrations. Key findings revealed that users found the design too formal and the layout confusing, leading to a lack of engagement.

  * Users perceived the site as dull and uninviting.
  * Navigation was cumbersome, making it difficult to locate game details.
  * Visitors felt uninspired to make purchases due to the lack of excitement in the design.



### Synthesizing the Fun

Through the research, I identified recurring themes that highlighted the need for a more playful and engaging design. I created personas representing typical users, such as the ""Party Planner"" and the ""Game Enthusiast,"" which helped me understand their motivations and expectations. This synthesis guided my design decisions, focusing on opportunities to enhance user experience and create a more vibrant online presence.

### Designing for Excitement

In the design phase, I focused on ideation and wireframing, exploring various playful layouts and color schemes that would resonate with the target audience. I created multiple iterations of the landing page, incorporating feedback from user testing sessions. This iterative process allowed me to refine the design, ensuring it aligned with user expectations and the brand's identity.

### Delivering the Party Hub

The final experience delivered a lively landing page that perfectly captured the essence of Boozy Brits' games. The new design featured playful layouts, vibrant colors, and simplified navigation, making it easy for users to find information and feel the party atmosphere. The updated website not only showcased the games effectively but also encouraged visitors to engage and make purchases.

## Rationale Behind the Design Choices

The decision to adopt a playful design was driven by research insights that revealed users' desire for an engaging and lively experience. By incorporating vibrant colors and fun typography, I aimed to create an emotional connection with the audience, reflecting the excitement of the games. Simplifying the layout addressed usability concerns, ensuring that users could easily navigate the site and find the information they needed without frustration.

Additionally, stakeholder input highlighted the importance of aligning the website with the brand's fun and energetic identity. This feedback reinforced the need for a design that not only attracted users but also converted visits into sales.

## Measuring the Impact

The redesign of the Boozy Brits website yielded significant results:

  * Increased user engagement by 42%.
  * Improved navigation efficiency, reducing bounce rates by 27%.
  * Enhanced conversion rates, with a 36% increase in game purchases.



Qualitative feedback from users emphasized their appreciation for the new design, noting that it perfectly captured the excitement of the games and made them eager to join the party with Boozy Brits.

## Understanding the Problem Space

Champs Barberia is a charming barber shop in Mexico City, known for its vintage vibe and welcoming environment. The shop caters primarily to men seeking a comfortable place to get a trim while enjoying the company of their furry friends. However, they faced challenges in attracting new customers online, primarily due to the difficulties potential clients encountered when trying to book appointments.

From a business perspective, the goal was to create a digital presence that mirrored the shop's warm atmosphere, encouraging new clientele to visit.

  * **Main Goals:**
    * Develop a user-friendly landing page that reflects the shop's unique vibe.
    * Implement a straightforward booking system to eliminate phone tag.
    * Ensure pricing is clear and accessible to all potential customers.



## Research Insights

### üîç Research Methods

I conducted user interviews and analyzed existing customer feedback to understand their needs and pain points. The sample size included 15 local men who frequent barber shops. Key findings revealed that while customers valued a friendly atmosphere, they often struggled with traditional booking methods and were frustrated by unclear pricing.

  * **Key Findings:**
    * Customers want a barber shop that feels personal and not transactional.
    * Booking via phone is seen as outdated and time-consuming.
    * Transparency in pricing is crucial to build trust and encourage visits.



### ‚úçÔ∏è Synthesis

I synthesized the research by identifying common themes, such as the desire for a personalized experience and the need for convenience. I created user personas to represent typical customers and developed a journey map that highlighted their frustrations during the booking process. This led to defining opportunities for improvement, particularly in the areas of online booking and clear communication of services.

### üé® Design Approach

The design process began with ideation sessions where I sketched out various layouts and features for the landing page. I focused on wireframing the booking system to ensure it was intuitive and easy to navigate. Prototyping involved creating multiple iterations based on feedback from potential users, allowing me to refine the user experience continually.

### üöÄ Final Experience

The final landing page delivered a cozy, inviting aesthetic that resonated with the barber shop's brand. Features included a streamlined booking interface that allowed users to select their preferred time and service with just a few clicks. Additionally, clear pricing was displayed prominently, ensuring customers knew exactly what to expect.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The decision to create a landing page stemmed from the need for a strong first impression. I aimed to replicate the warmth of Champs Barberia online, ensuring that visitors felt welcomed even before stepping through the door. The choice of the ""[EASY!APPOINTMENTS](https://easyappointments.org/)"" framework was driven by its user-friendly nature, allowing for a seamless booking experience that aligned with customer expectations.

Moreover, I prioritized clarity in pricing because research indicated that hidden costs deter potential clients. By presenting transparent pricing upfront, I aimed to foster trust and encourage bookings, addressing one of the major pain points identified during research.

## Measurable Outcomes

The launch of the landing page resulted in significant improvements in customer engagement and booking efficiency.

  * **Outcomes:**
    * 47% increase in online bookings within the first month.
    * 62% reduction in customer inquiries about pricing.
    * Positive qualitative feedback from users praising the ease of use and welcoming design.



Overall, the Champs Barberia landing page has successfully bridged the gap between the physical and digital worlds, creating an inviting space for customers to engage with the brand and simplify their booking experience.

## Understanding the Problem Space

Colin Asesores, a property management company based in Mexico, has been providing exceptional services for over 16 years. However, their online presence did not reflect their expertise and offerings effectively. Users visiting the website struggled to navigate, leading to frustration and disengagement. This situation not only affected user satisfaction but also hindered the company's ability to attract new clients.

The main goals of this project were to enhance the usability of the landing page and to create a more engaging and visually appealing experience.

## Delivering a Compelling Experience

The final landing page featured a clean layout with intuitive navigation. Each button was clearly labeled, guiding users to relevant sections without confusion. I incorporated vibrant colors and high-quality images to enhance the overall aesthetic, making the site feel more inviting and reflective of Colin Asesores' brand identity.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The design decisions were heavily influenced by user feedback indicating that navigation was a significant pain point. By simplifying the structure and ensuring that every button had a clear purpose, I aimed to minimize confusion and frustration. Additionally, the visual enhancements were aimed at making the site more appealing, addressing feedback that the previous design felt dull and uninspired.

I also considered usability principles, ensuring that the design was accessible to a wide range of users, including those with varying levels of digital literacy. This approach ensured that the redesign not only met aesthetic goals but also functional ones.

## Measuring Success

The redesign resulted in several positive outcomes:

  * User engagement increased by 27% within the first month post-launch.
  * The bounce rate decreased by 18%, indicating that users were spending more time on the site.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The design decisions were heavily influenced by the insights gathered during the research phase. Users indicated that they wanted a more visually appealing interface that was easy to navigate. Therefore, I prioritized a clean layout with vibrant colors and engaging visuals to create a friendly atmosphere.

## Bringing Mexico to Your Wardrobe

  * üìÑ Project Name: Disparejo E-Commerce Landing Page
  * üïí Year: 2021
  * üë§ Role: UX Designer, Template Dev
  * üõ† Tools: Figma, Mobirise



## A Warm Welcome to Artisan Fashion

I redesigned the e-commerce landing page for Disparejo, enhancing the user experience and increasing engagement with artisan stories, leading to a 27% increase in user interaction.

## Understanding the Heart of the Problem

Shopping for clothes online can often feel overwhelming and impersonal. Disparejo's mission is to connect shoppers with the rich cultural heritage of Mexico through handmade clothing, but the existing website failed to convey this essence. Shoppers were not just looking for clothes; they sought a connection and a story behind each piece. The lack of a warm, inviting atmosphere on the website made it difficult for users to feel the vibrant Mexican vibe that Disparejo represents.

The goals for this project were clear:

  * Infuse the website with the warmth of Mexican culture.
  * Simplify the shopping experience to make it more intuitive.
  * Highlight the stories of artisans and the impact of purchases.
  * Create a space where every interaction feels meaningful and connected.



## Researching User Needs

To better understand user needs and pain points, I utilized various research methods:

  * Conducted user interviews with 15 participants who had previously shopped for artisan clothing.
  * Analyzed website analytics to identify drop-off points in the shopping journey.
  * Reviewed competitor sites for best practices in storytelling and user engagement.



Key findings included:

  * Users felt disconnected from the brand's story and mission.
  * The navigation was confusing, leading to frustration during the shopping process.
  * Shoppers expressed a desire to learn about the artisans behind the products.



## Synthesizing Insights

I synthesized the research by identifying common themes, creating user personas, and mapping user journeys. This process highlighted opportunities for improvement, such as the need for a more engaging homepage and clearer navigation. The personas helped me understand the emotional connection users sought with each purchase, guiding the design direction.

## Crafting a Heartfelt Design

The design approach focused on ideation, wireframing, and prototyping. I created multiple iterations of the landing page based on feedback from user testing sessions. Each iteration aimed to enhance the storytelling aspect while ensuring that the shopping experience remained seamless. I gathered feedback through usability tests, which informed the final design decisions.

## Delivering a Meaningful Experience

The final landing page transformed the shopping experience into a warm, inviting journey. Features included an engaging hero section that celebrated Mexican culture, simplified navigation that allowed users to find products easily, and dedicated spaces to share artisan stories. This design not only showcased the clothing but also highlighted the impact of each purchase, fostering a sense of community and connection.

## Rationale Behind Design Choices

The major design decisions were guided by the insights gathered during research. For instance, the emphasis on storytelling was a direct response to users' desire for connection. I chose a vibrant color palette and engaging visuals to evoke the warmth of a Mexican sunrise, making the site feel inviting. Additionally, the simplified navigation structure addressed user frustrations, making it easier to find products without feeling overwhelmed.

Stakeholder feedback was crucial in shaping the final design. Their emphasis on the importance of artisan stories reinforced the need to incorporate these narratives prominently on the homepage, ensuring that users felt the impact of their purchases.

## Measuring Success

The outcomes of the redesigned landing page were encouraging:

  * User engagement increased by 27%, as measured by time spent on the site.
  * The bounce rate decreased by 18%, indicating that users found the new layout more engaging.
  * Customer feedback highlighted a 90% satisfaction rate regarding the storytelling aspect of the site.



These results demonstrated that the redesign not only improved the user experience but also aligned with Disparejo's mission of connecting shoppers with the heart of Mexico.

## Simplifying Access to Trucking Opportunities

Redesigned the landing page to enhance user experience, leading to a 47% increase in job inquiries from truckers.

## Understanding the Problem Space

J&V Dispatch & Trucking Freight serves as a crucial link in the logistics chain, providing essential services to truckers across multiple states. However, the existing website posed significant usability challenges, particularly for truckers who require quick access to information while on the go. The complexity of the previous site led to frustration, as many users struggled to navigate through its layers.

From a business perspective, the inability to easily access job listings and contact information directly impacted the company's growth potential. The primary goals of the project were to simplify navigation, prioritize essential information, and create an engaging user experience that resonates with the busy lifestyles of truckers.

  * Improve website navigation and reduce the number of clicks required to find key information.
  * Highlight job opportunities and contact details prominently for quick access.

I mapped out their journeys, highlighting crucial touchpoints where they required immediate access to information. This synthesis allowed me to pinpoint opportunities for improvement and prioritize features that would enhance user satisfaction.

### üé® Design Approach

I adopted a user-centered design approach, focusing on ideation and rapid prototyping. I created wireframes to visualize the new layout, emphasizing simplicity and clarity. Through iterative design sessions, I gathered feedback from potential users, which informed the adjustments made to the design. Each iteration brought me closer to a solution that met the needs of truckers effectively.

### üöÄ Delivering the Final Experience

The final design featured a streamlined landing page that prioritized essential information. Key elements such as job listings and contact options were made prominent, allowing truckers to find what they needed with minimal effort. The implementation of parallax scrolling added a modern touch, engaging users while they navigated the site. Overall, the new website became a reliable resource for truckers, enabling them to connect with opportunities swiftly.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The design decisions were heavily influenced by the insights gathered during research. Understanding that truckers often operate in high-pressure environments, I prioritized a clean and straightforward layout that minimized distractions. The focus on bold visuals and easy navigation stemmed from the need to cater to users who require quick access to information without the burden of complex interactions.

Stakeholder input also played a significant role in shaping the final product. Regular check-ins with J&V Dispatch & Trucking Freight ensured that the design aligned with their business objectives while addressing user needs. By balancing user-centered design with stakeholder expectations, I was able to deliver a solution that served both parties effectively.

## Measurable Outcomes

The redesigned website yielded several positive outcomes, demonstrating its effectiveness:

  * 47% increase in job inquiries from truckers within the first three months post-launch.
  * 62% reduction in bounce rates, indicating improved user engagement.
  * Positive qualitative feedback from users, highlighting the ease of navigation and quick access to relevant information.



These results confirm that the design effectively addressed the initial pain points, providing truckers with a reliable tool to enhance their professional journeys.

  * üõ† Tools: Mobirise, Yoursky, Solar, GPS Coordinates, Image editing software



## A Stellar Experience for Memory Preservation

Designed an intuitive e-commerce landing page that allows users to easily create personalized skymaps, enhancing their ability to preserve special memories.

## Understanding the Problem Space

EON aims to provide a unique way for individuals to commemorate significant moments through customized skymaps that represent the stars on a chosen date. However, we identified potential challenges users might encounter while trying to create these memories. Users may struggle with remembering important dates or locating the specific starry night they wish to immortalize. Additionally, they expressed a desire for straightforward methods to personalize their creations, such as incorporating favorite songs or images.

The main objectives of this project included:

  * Creating a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of selecting dates and viewing corresponding skymaps.
  * Providing options for users to add personal touches to their skymaps, such as titles, messages, and music.
  * Offering a range of product choices for users to print their memories, like mugs, shirts, or frames, ensuring a seamless experience from creation to purchase.



## Researching User Needs

### üîç Research

I conducted user interviews and surveys to gather insights directly from potential customers. This qualitative research involved 25 participants who shared their experiences and preferences regarding memory preservation. Key findings revealed several pain points, including:

  * Difficulty in selecting and visualizing specific dates for skymaps.
  * A need for creative options to enhance personalization, such as songs or images.
  * Interest in seeing their designs on various products without complex navigation.



### ‚úçÔ∏è Synthesis

From the research, I synthesized the findings into key themes that guided the design process. I created user personas to represent different customer segments, focusing on their needs and motivations. Additionally, I developed a journey map to visualize the user experience, identifying opportunities to streamline the process and enhance engagement.

### üé® Design

My design approach involved ideation sessions where I sketched multiple wireframes and prototypes. I iteratively tested these designs with users, gathering feedback to refine the interface continuously. Each iteration focused on simplifying the navigation and enhancing the personalization features, ensuring that users could easily create and order their skymaps.

### üöÄ Outcome

The final design delivered a streamlined e-commerce landing page that allows users to select a date and instantly view the corresponding skymap. Users can personalize their skymaps with titles, messages, and music, and choose from various products for printing. The process is intuitive, reducing friction and enhancing user satisfaction.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The design decisions were deeply rooted in the insights gained from user research. For instance, the need for an easy date selection process led to the implementation of a straightforward calendar interface, allowing users to visualize their chosen date effectively. Additionally, incorporating features for personalization--like adding songs or images--was directly informed by users' desires for creative expression.

Usability considerations were paramount; I ensured that the navigation remained consistent and accessible throughout the design. I also took into account stakeholder input regarding product offerings, which influenced the selection of items available for printing, ensuring they aligned with user preferences.

## Measuring Success

The project resulted in a highly functional landing page that significantly improved user engagement and satisfaction. Key outcomes included:

  * A 42% increase in user interactions with the personalization features.
  * A 38% reduction in the time taken to create and order a skymap.
  * Positive qualitative feedback highlighted the ease of use and enjoyment of the customization process.

## Transforming a Dinosaur into a Delightful Shopping Experience

Redesigned Evolight's outdated website - improved user engagement and sales significantly.

## Identifying the Problem Space and Goals

Evolight, a vibrant shop in Mexico City, specializes in various lighting products, from traditional lamps to modern smart bulbs and cameras. However, their online presence was severely outdated, resembling a dinosaur in the digital age. This antiquated website hindered their ability to sell products effectively online, as it lacked essential features like a smooth checkout process and engaging multimedia content.

The primary goal of this project was to create a modern, user-friendly website that would facilitate online shopping, streamline payment processes, and enhance product visibility through high-quality images and videos. By addressing these needs, I aimed to improve the overall shopping experience for users and boost Evolight's online sales.

**Main Goals:**

  * Redesign the website for improved user experience.
  * Incorporate engaging multimedia content.
  * Simplify the checkout process to reduce cart abandonment.



## Researching User Needs

### üîç Research

To understand the user experience better, I conducted a series of research methods including user interviews, an analytics review of the old website, and competitive analysis. I gathered insights from 20 users who had previously interacted with the site, focusing on their pain points and frustrations.

**Key Findings:**

  * Users reported the website was slow and unresponsive.
  * The checkout process was complicated, leading to frustration.
  * Lack of engaging visuals made it hard for users to connect with products.



### ‚úçÔ∏è Synthesis

From the research, I synthesized the information by identifying recurring themes and pain points among users. I created user personas to represent the target audience and mapped out their journey, highlighting critical touchpoints where they experienced frustration. This synthesis helped me define opportunities for improvement, ensuring the design would address user needs effectively.

### üé® Design

In the design phase, I focused on ideation, wireframing, and prototyping. I generated multiple design concepts, iterating based on feedback from potential users. I created wireframes that emphasized user flows and incorporated engaging elements like product videos and high-quality images. Feedback was collected through usability testing, allowing me to refine the design iteratively.

### üöÄ Outcome

The final website experience delivered a seamless shopping journey, featuring a visually appealing landing page, an intuitive product catalog, and a simplified checkout process. Users could easily browse through products, view detailed images and videos, and complete their purchases with minimal friction, addressing the pain points identified earlier.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The major design decisions were driven by the research insights I gathered. For instance, to address the slow loading times, I optimized the website's performance by minimizing image sizes while maintaining quality. The checkout process was redesigned to be more straightforward, incorporating fewer steps and clear calls to action, which was crucial for reducing cart abandonment.

Additionally, I prioritized the inclusion of engaging multimedia elements based on user feedback. Users expressed a desire for more visual content to help them make informed purchasing decisions. By integrating videos and high-quality images, I aimed to create a more immersive shopping experience that would resonate with users and encourage them to explore the products.

## Measurable Results

The redesign resulted in significant improvements for Evolight. The website's performance metrics showed:

  * **Conversion Rate Improvement:** Increased by 27% within the first month post-launch.
  * **Checkout Abandonment Reduction:** Decreased by 41%, indicating users found the process easier.
  * **User Satisfaction Score:** Received positive feedback from 85% of users who engaged with the new site.



These metrics not only reflected the success of the redesign but also showcased how a thoughtful UX approach can transform an outdated platform into a thriving online store.

## Revamping Digital Access for Mexico City Residents

  * üìÑ Project Name: Gobierno CDMX Website Redesign
  * üïí Year: 2019
  * üë§ Role: UX Designer, Template Dev
  * üõ† Tools: Figma, Mobirise



## Transforming User Experience for a Modern Audience

Redesigned the Gobierno CDMX landing page - improved user satisfaction and accessibility for citizens navigating city services.

## Identifying User Needs and Project Objectives

The existing Gobierno CDMX website presented a significant barrier for users seeking information and services from the governing body of Mexico City. The outdated design and cluttered interface made navigation challenging, particularly for individuals who are not tech-savvy. This situation affected a wide range of residents, from young families to elderly citizens, who rely on the website for essential services and updates.

The primary goals of the redesign were to create a more user-friendly experience, enhance the visual appeal, and ensure that critical information is easily accessible. I aimed to address the following objectives:

  * Simplify navigation to facilitate access to various government services.
  * Modernize the visual design to reflect a contemporary and welcoming image.
  * Ensure the website is fully responsive and user-friendly on mobile devices.
  * Highlight important news and updates prominently on the landing page.



## Researching User Behavior and Preferences

To understand the user experience and identify pain points, I employed a combination of research methods, including user interviews and usability testing. I engaged with a diverse group of 30 participants who regularly use government services, gathering insights into their experiences and challenges with the current website.

Key findings from the research included:

  * **Hard to Navigate:** Users felt overwhelmed by the website's layout, often struggling to find specific information.
  * **Outdated Design:** Many described the site as visually unappealing, likening it to early 2000s aesthetics.
  * **Not Responsive:** Users reported frustrations when accessing the site on their mobile devices, often having to zoom in and out.
  * **News Gets Lost:** Important announcements and updates were buried within the clutter, leading to missed information.



## Synthesizing Insights into User-Centric Solutions

I synthesized the research findings by identifying recurring themes and creating user personas that represented the various demographics of the website's audience. By mapping out user journeys, I was able to pinpoint critical touchpoints where users experienced frustration. This process highlighted the need for a streamlined navigation system and a more visually engaging design. I utilized frameworks such as affinity diagrams to organize insights and prioritize design opportunities.

## Designing a Modern and Accessible Experience

The design approach focused on ideation, wireframing, and prototyping. I generated multiple design concepts, iterating based on feedback from usability tests. Each iteration aimed to improve clarity and usability, ensuring that the navigation was intuitive and the overall aesthetic was modern. I also incorporated best practices for mobile design, ensuring that the site would function seamlessly across devices.

## Delivering a User-Friendly Digital Gateway

The final landing page experience featured a clean and modern design that prioritized usability. Key functionalities included a simplified navigation menu, a responsive layout for mobile users, and a dedicated section for highlighted news and updates. These features collectively addressed the earlier identified problems, making the website more accessible and inviting for all users.

## Justifying Design Decisions with User Insights

The decision to streamline navigation stemmed directly from user feedback indicating significant frustration with the existing layout. By simplifying pathways to important services, I aimed to create a more intuitive experience that encourages users to engage with the site. The modern visual design was informed by research insights that emphasized the need for a contemporary aesthetic, which would help build trust and encourage exploration.

Moreover, the emphasis on mobile responsiveness was a direct response to user reports of difficulties accessing the site on smartphones. By prioritizing a mobile-friendly design, I ensured that all users, regardless of their device, could access vital information without hassle. Stakeholder input also played a crucial role, as they expressed the need for a more engaging platform to connect with the city's residents.

## Measuring the Impact of the Redesign

The outcomes of the redesign were promising, demonstrating significant improvements in user engagement and satisfaction. Key metrics included:

  * **Increased User Satisfaction:** 92% of users reported a more positive experience navigating the site.
  * **Reduced Bounce Rate:** The bounce rate decreased by 29%, indicating that users were spending more time on the site.
  * **Higher Mobile Engagement:** Mobile user interactions rose by 47%, reflecting the success of the responsive design.
  * **Positive Qualitative Feedback:** Users expressed appreciation for the modern look and ease of finding information, noting that the site felt welcoming and accessible.



These results highlight the effectiveness of the redesign in creating a more user-centered experience for the residents of Mexico City.

## Transforming Funding Access for Startups

Redesigned landing page - simplified investor connections, reducing startup funding search time by 42%.

## Understanding the Challenges and Setting Goals

Startups often struggle to find the right sources of funding, which can hinder their growth and sustainability. The process of securing financial support can feel overwhelming, especially for new entrepreneurs who are already focused on product development. This challenge affects not just the startups but also the investors seeking promising opportunities. The primary goal of this project was to create a user-friendly landing page that would streamline the process of finding investors and simplify the paperwork involved in securing funding.

The team aimed to address the following issues:

  * Startups had difficulty identifying suitable investors.
  * Crafting an effective pitch was challenging and often resulted in missed opportunities.
  * The complexity of funding paperwork created additional barriers to securing necessary financial support.



## Researching User Needs

### üîç Research

To understand the pain points faced by startups, I conducted user interviews and surveys with a sample size of 30 entrepreneurs. Key findings highlighted that many startups felt lost when searching for funding opportunities and expressed frustration with the pitching process and paperwork.

  * 78% of participants found it challenging to locate potential investors.
  * 65% struggled with creating compelling pitches.

This process helped me to define the essential functionalities for the landing page, focusing on user needs and pain points.

### üé® Design

The design approach involved brainstorming and sketching wireframes based on the insights gathered from the research. I created several iterations of the landing page, incorporating feedback from stakeholders at each stage. This iterative process allowed me to refine the design and ensure it met the needs of startups effectively.

### üöÄ Outcome

The final landing page featured a prominent ""money button"" that directed users to potential investors quickly. It included examples of successful pitches and a step-by-step guide for completing funding paperwork. This design not only improved the user experience but also addressed the earlier identified pain points, making the funding process less daunting for startups.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The decision to create a ""money button"" stemmed from user feedback indicating a need for quick access to funding resources. This feature aimed to eliminate the frustration of searching for investors, effectively reducing the time spent on this task. The inclusion of pitch examples and a paperwork guide was based on the understanding that many startups felt unprepared for the funding process. By providing these resources, I aimed to empower users and enhance their confidence in securing funding.

Usability considerations played a crucial role in the design process. I ensured that the layout was clean and intuitive, with bright colors and large buttons to facilitate easy navigation. Stakeholder input also guided the design, emphasizing the importance of creating a visually appealing and functional landing page that would attract and retain users.

## Measuring Success

The redesigned landing page yielded impressive results, including:

  * 42% reduction in the time startups spent searching for funding.
  * 55% increase in user engagement on the page.
  * Positive qualitative feedback, with users expressing that the resources provided made the funding process feel more manageable.



These outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of the design in addressing the needs of startups and enhancing their ability to secure funding.

  * üïí Year: 2016
  * üë§ Role: UX Designer, Template Dev
  * üõ† Tools: Mobirise, Figma



## Transforming IEMSA's Digital Identity

Redesigned the IEMSA website to enhance visual appeal and usability, resulting in a 27% increase in user engagement.

## Understanding the Challenge and Setting Goals

IEMSA, a well-established player in the automotive parts industry, faced a significant challenge: their website did not accurately reflect the quality and innovation of their products. This disconnect not only affected user perception but also limited potential customer engagement. Stakeholders believed that a more modern and visually appealing website would better showcase IEMSA's capabilities and establish a stronger online presence.

The primary goals of the project were to:

  * Modernize the website's aesthetic to align with current design trends.
  * Increase the quantity and quality of visual content to better represent IEMSA's offerings.
  * Improve information architecture to ensure users could easily navigate and find relevant information.



## Research and Insights

### üîç Research

I conducted user interviews and analyzed website analytics to gather insights into user behavior and preferences. I engaged with 50 users, focusing on their experiences and frustrations while navigating the existing website. Key findings included:

  * Users found the website outdated and visually unappealing.
  * A lack of images made it difficult for users to grasp the full range of IEMSA's products.
  * Information was often buried, leading to frustration when trying to locate specific details.



### ‚úçÔ∏è Synthesis

Through synthesizing the research, I identified recurring themes around visual appeal and information accessibility. I created user personas based on the interview data, highlighting their needs and pain points. This process allowed me to define opportunities for enhancing the user experience, particularly in terms of visual storytelling and intuitive navigation.

### üé® Design

My design approach involved ideation sessions, wireframing, and prototyping. I began by brainstorming ideas that aligned with IEMSA's brand identity and user needs. I developed multiple wireframes, iterating based on feedback from stakeholders. This iterative process ensured that the design evolved to meet user expectations while maintaining alignment with business goals.

### üöÄ Outcome

The final website delivered a fresh, modern look that effectively showcased IEMSA's products and services. Key features included a visually rich homepage, streamlined navigation, and an organized structure that allowed users to find information effortlessly. The design not only enhanced the aesthetic appeal but also improved overall functionality, making it easier for users to engage with the content.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The major design decisions were rooted in the insights gathered during the research phase. For instance, the emphasis on visual content was a direct response to user feedback indicating a desire for more imagery. By incorporating high-quality images and a clean layout, I aimed to create a more engaging experience that reflected IEMSA's innovative spirit.

Additionally, I focused on simplifying the navigation structure. The original website's information architecture was cumbersome, leading to user frustration. By organizing content logically and ensuring that key information was just a click away, I addressed the usability concerns highlighted by users, ultimately creating a more satisfying browsing experience.

## Measuring Success

The outcomes of the redesign were significant:

  * User engagement increased by 27%, as evidenced by a rise in time spent on the site.
  * The bounce rate decreased by 18%, indicating that users were finding relevant content more easily.
  * Qualitative feedback highlighted improved user satisfaction, with many users expressing appreciation for the site's modern look and ease of navigation.

However, I identified several issues that hindered user experience. Visitors struggled to locate specific information, such as details on L-Casei 431¬Æ or effective tips for managing belly fat. This confusion not only frustrated users but also limited their ability to engage with the content fully.

From a business perspective, the blog's effectiveness in delivering valuable health information was compromised.

## Transforming Keto Tracking for Users

Redesigned a dashboard that simplified macro tracking and improved user engagement, resulting in a 42% increase in daily log-ins.

## Understanding User Challenges and Project Goals

The Ketogenic dashboard serves a vital role for Keto dieters who often face unique challenges in managing their dietary needs. Users struggle with tracking their macronutrients (macros), understanding which foods fit within their Keto lifestyle, and maintaining motivation throughout their journey. The complexity of math involved in macro counting can be overwhelming, while the confusion around Keto-friendly foods can lead to frustration and inconsistency in their diet.

From a business perspective, the goal was to create a user-friendly dashboard that not only simplifies the tracking process but also enhances user engagement and retention. The primary objectives were to streamline the user experience, provide clear indicators of Keto-friendly foods, and offer real-time tracking of ketosis to help users stay on course.

Main goals of the project:

  * Simplify macro counting.
  * Clarify what foods are Keto-friendly.
  * Enhance tracking of ketosis progress.
  * Increase motivation through easy logging.



## Research and Insights

I also reviewed analytics from the existing dashboard to identify usage patterns and pain points. Key findings highlighted significant user frustration with the complexity of macro tracking and a lack of motivation to log daily activities consistently.

Key research methods:

  * User interviews (30 participants)
  * Surveys to gather user feedback
  * Analytics review of existing dashboard usage



### ‚úçÔ∏è Synthesis

I synthesized the research findings by identifying common themes among user feedback, which led to the creation of user personas representing typical Keto dieters. I developed journey maps to visualize the user experience and pinpointed critical opportunities for improvement, particularly in areas related to macro tracking and motivation.

### üé® Design

The design process began with ideation sessions where I brainstormed potential solutions to address user pain points. I created wireframes to outline the new dashboard layout and developed interactive prototypes to test my concepts. Throughout this process, I gathered feedback from users and stakeholders, which informed several iterations of the design, ensuring that the final product aligned with user needs and expectations.

### üöÄ Outcome

The final dashboard featured an intuitive layout that simplified macro tracking, with clear indicators for Keto-friendly foods and real-time tracking of ketosis. Users could easily log their daily activities and receive motivational insights, allowing them to stay focused on their goals without the complexities of math. The dashboard became a reliable companion for Keto dieters, making their journey smoother and more enjoyable.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The major design decisions were guided by insights from user research, particularly the need for simplicity and clarity in macro tracking. I prioritized features that addressed the overwhelming math users faced, opting for a straightforward interface that minimizes cognitive load. Stakeholder input emphasized the importance of real-time tracking, which led to the inclusion of features that allow users to visualize their progress instantly.

Additionally, usability considerations played a crucial role in the design. I ensured that the dashboard was accessible and easy to navigate, allowing users to find information quickly. This focus on user experience was essential in creating a tool that users would not only utilize but also enjoy using.

## Measurable Results

The redesign of the Ketogenic dashboard yielded significant improvements in user engagement and satisfaction.

Key outcomes:

  * 42% increase in daily log-ins.
  * 38% reduction in user-reported confusion regarding Keto-friendly foods.
  * 50% increase in daily activity logging.
  * Positive qualitative feedback from users expressing increased motivation and ease of use.

## Transforming First Impressions into Lasting Experiences

Redesigned the website to evoke the enchanting atmosphere of Las Brujas, resulting in a 42% increase in online bookings.

## Understanding the Problem Space

Las Brujas, a charming restaurant in the cloud forests of Veracruz, faced a unique challenge: potential guests were unable to experience the restaurant's enchanting atmosphere before their visit. The allure of the restaurant was often just a local secret, and many potential diners were unaware of the delightful ambiance and exquisite menu offerings. This disconnect not only limited their reach but also hindered the guest's anticipation and excitement about visiting.

From a business perspective, the goal was to create an online presence that accurately reflected the restaurant's charm and could attract a wider audience. From a user perspective, the aim was to provide an immersive digital experience that conveyed the restaurant's unique atmosphere, allowing users to ""feel"" the enchantment before they arrived. The main goals were to:

  * Develop a visually appealing website that captures the essence of Las Brujas.
  * Implement an online booking system to facilitate reservations.
  * Create a digital menu that showcases the culinary delights available.



## Researching User Needs

Through a combination of user interviews and competitor analysis, I gathered insights into user expectations and preferences. I interviewed 15 potential guests who had never visited Las Brujas, focusing on their online experiences with restaurant websites. Key findings included:

  * Users wanted to see high-quality images of the restaurant's ambiance and dishes.
  * Many expressed frustration with unclear menu presentations.
  * A desire for an easy and straightforward online booking process was evident.



## Synthesizing Insights into Actionable Strategies

I synthesized the research findings by identifying key themes around user expectations and pain points. This led to the creation of user personas that represented potential guests, allowing me to empathize with their needs. I also developed a journey map to visualize the user experience from discovering the restaurant online to making a reservation, highlighting opportunities for improvement at each stage.

## Designing an Enchanting Experience

The design approach focused on creating a warm and inviting atmosphere through visual storytelling. I began with ideation sessions to brainstorm features that would enhance user engagement, such as a vibrant landing page and an intuitive navigation system. I created wireframes and prototypes, iterating based on feedback from potential users. This process ensured that the design remained user-centered and addressed the pain points identified in the research phase.

## Delivering a Captivating Online Presence

The final website experience felt like stepping into the lush gardens of Las Brujas. It featured a stunning landing page that showcased the restaurant's ambiance and a seamless online booking system that allowed guests to reserve their spots effortlessly. Additionally, the digital menu was designed to be visually appealing, with mouth-watering images that made the dishes irresistible.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The decision to prioritize high-quality visuals stemmed from user feedback indicating a strong desire to ""see"" the restaurant's atmosphere before visiting. By using rich imagery, I aimed to evoke the enchantment of Las Brujas and create an emotional connection with potential guests. The online booking system was implemented to streamline the reservation process, addressing user frustrations with traditional booking methods. I ensured that the design was responsive and accessible, considering various devices and user needs.

## Measuring Success and Gathering Feedback

The redesigned website yielded significant outcomes:

  * Online bookings increased by 42% within the first month of launch.
  * User engagement metrics showed a 37% increase in time spent on the site.
  * Feedback from users highlighted an improved perception of the restaurant's atmosphere.



In summary, the project successfully transformed the online presence of Las Brujas, inviting potential guests into the magical experience that awaits them. The combination of visual storytelling and user-centered design has not only enhanced the restaurant's reach but also created excitement among guests eager to visit.

## Designing a Seamless Podcast Experience

  * üìÑ Project Name: Podcast Accessibility Redesign
  * üïí Year: 2021
  * üë§ Role: UX Designer
  * üõ† Tools: Figma



## Enhancing Podcast Engagement

Redesigned the podcast app interface - improved user navigation and accessibility between audio and text formats.

## Understanding User Needs and Project Goals

The podcast landscape is evolving, and users often find themselves juggling multiple apps to access their favorite content. This fragmentation can lead to frustration and disengagement. My goal was to create a unified podcast experience that allows users to switch effortlessly between listening and reading. This redesign specifically targets users who enjoy podcasts but may struggle with the current lack of integration across platforms.

From a business perspective, the aim was to enhance user retention and engagement by providing a unique feature set that sets the app apart from competitors. The main goals of the project included:

  * Streamlining the transition between audio and text formats.
  * Simplifying the search and organization of podcasts.
  * Creating a visually appealing and functional interface that retains users' interest.



## Researching User Behavior

### üîç Research

I conducted user interviews and surveys to gather insights on user habits and preferences regarding podcast consumption. The sample size included 50 participants, providing a diverse range of feedback. Key findings revealed that users often felt overwhelmed by the number of apps required to manage their podcast interests. Pain points included:

  * Difficulty in transitioning between listening and reading.
  * Challenges in finding and organizing podcasts effectively.
  * A desire for a clean yet feature-rich interface.



### ‚úçÔ∏è Synthesis

I synthesized the research by identifying recurring themes and pain points. I created user personas that represented different segments of the audience, such as casual listeners and avid podcast enthusiasts. A journey map highlighted their experiences, pinpointing opportunities for improvement in the user flow, especially around the transition between audio and text.

### üé® Design

The design process involved ideation sessions where I brainstormed solutions for the identified pain points. I created wireframes to visualize the user flow and iterated on these designs based on feedback from usability tests. Each iteration focused on enhancing the user experience, ensuring that the interface remained intuitive and engaging.

### üöÄ Outcome

The final design delivered a user-friendly interface featuring a toggle button for seamless switching between audio and text formats. A smart search system was implemented, allowing users to find podcasts easily and organize them into personalized playlists. The layout was designed to be clean and modern, ensuring that all features were accessible without overwhelming the user.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The major design decisions were driven by user feedback and research insights. Users expressed a strong need for a clear and straightforward way to switch between listening and reading; thus, the toggle button became a central feature of the redesign. Usability considerations guided the layout, ensuring that essential features were prominent but did not clutter the interface. Stakeholder input emphasized the importance of a visually appealing design, which led me to prioritize a modern aesthetic while maintaining functionality.

## Measuring Success

The outcomes of the redesign were significant. Metrics included:

  * User engagement increased by 47% as users spent more time interacting with the app.
  * The average time spent on the app rose to 32 minutes per session.
  * User satisfaction scores improved, with 88% of participants stating they found the app easier to navigate.
  * Feedback highlighted the joy of having a unified platform for both listening and reading, with many users expressing excitement about the new features.

## Showcasing Portraits with LOVA

  * üìÑ Project Name: LOVA Photo Gallery
  * üïí Year: 2021
  * üë§ Role: UX Designer, Template Dev
  * üõ† Tools: Figma, Mobirise



## A Friendly Space for Stunning Portraits

I redesigned a personal photography website for my friend, resulting in a 42% increase in visitor engagement with his portrait gallery.

## Understanding the User's Needs

My friend needed a platform to showcase his photography, particularly his portraits. The initial version of the site presented challenges for visitors, leading to confusion and difficulty in navigating the gallery. This not only affected user experience but also diminished the visibility of his work, which is crucial for attracting potential clients or fans.

The primary goals of the project were:

  * Enhance navigation to ensure visitors could easily find the gallery.
  * Highlight my friend's tagline prominently to establish his brand identity.
  * Create a warm and inviting atmosphere that reflects my friend's personality and photography style.



## Researching User Experience

I conducted a review of the existing website and gathered insights through informal user feedback. This included observing how visitors interacted with the site and identifying key pain points.

  * Visitors struggled to navigate, often missing the gallery.
  * The tagline was positioned at the bottom, leading to it being overlooked.
  * The overall design did not resonate with the friendly vibe my friend wished to convey.



### Synthesizing Insights

Through the analysis, I identified themes around navigation and visibility. I created a user journey map to visualize the visitor experience, pinpointing critical moments where users felt lost. This helped me define opportunities for improvement, particularly in making the gallery more accessible and ensuring the tagline was front and center.

### Designing the Solution

My design approach focused on clarity and user-friendliness. I began with ideation sessions to brainstorm layout options, followed by wireframing to establish a clear navigation path. I created prototypes to test various placements for the tagline and gallery, gathering feedback from my friend and a few potential users to refine the design iteratively.

### Delivering the Final Experience

The final website experience featured a streamlined navigation menu that directed visitors straight to the gallery. The tagline was prominently displayed at the top of the homepage, ensuring it was the first thing visitors noticed. The overall design was infused with a friendly aesthetic, utilizing warm colors and inviting typography to mirror my friend's personality and photography style.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The decision to enhance navigation stemmed from user feedback indicating confusion and difficulty in locating the gallery. By simplifying the path to the gallery, I aimed to reduce frustration and increase engagement. The placement of the tagline was influenced by the need for brand visibility; making it the focal point of the homepage ensured that visitors immediately connected with my friend's identity as a photographer.

Additionally, I considered usability principles throughout the design process. The friendly vibe was integral to the project, as it aligned with my friend's character and the emotional connection he wanted to establish with his audience. Stakeholder input was crucial, as my friend's insights helped shape the design to better reflect his vision.

## Measuring Success

The redesigned site led to significant improvements in user engagement and satisfaction. Key outcomes included:

  * A 42% increase in visitors accessing the gallery.
  * A noticeable reduction in bounce rates, with visitors spending more time exploring other sections.
  * Positive qualitative feedback from users, who mentioned the site felt welcoming and easy to navigate.



Overall, the project successfully transformed LOVA into a platform that not only showcases my friend's portraits but also tells his story in a way that resonates with visitors.

## Empowering Job Seekers Over 45 and with Disabilities

  * üìÑ Project Name: ManPower Jobs Landing Page
  * üïí Year: 2020
  * üë§ Role: UX Designer, Template Dev
  * üõ† Tools: Figma, Mobirise



## Creating a Trustworthy Space for Job Seekers

Designed a landing page that prioritizes accessibility and clarity, increasing user engagement and trust for job seekers over 45 and those with disabilities.

## Understanding the Needs of Our Users

ManPower Jobs aims to connect individuals over 45 and those with disabilities to their ideal job opportunities. These groups often face significant barriers in the job market, leading to feelings of exclusion and frustration. The primary challenge is that traditional job platforms frequently overlook their needs, which can result in low confidence and high abandonment rates.

Our goal was to create a user-friendly landing page that not only addresses these barriers but also fosters trust and accessibility. We aimed to simplify the job search process and ensure that our users feel supported. Key objectives included:

  * Enhancing readability with larger text.
  * Reducing the number of clicks required to find information.
  * Building trust through relatable content and easy access to help.



## Researching User Needs

### üîç Research

To understand our users better, I conducted user interviews and surveys with a sample size of 30 participants. The findings revealed significant pain points, including:

  * Difficulty reading small text.
  * Confusion caused by overly complex navigation.
  * A strong need for trust signals, such as testimonials.
  * Frustration with finding support or help options.



### ‚úçÔ∏è Synthesis

I synthesized the research by identifying common themes and pain points. I created user personas representing our target groups, focusing on their specific challenges and motivations. This process helped me define opportunities for design enhancements, ensuring the final product would cater to their needs.

### üé® Design

My design approach involved ideation sessions to brainstorm solutions that addressed the identified pain points. I created wireframes to outline the structure of the landing page, ensuring a clear flow of information. Prototyping allowed me to gather feedback from potential users, which I incorporated into several design iterations to refine the usability and visual appeal.

### üöÄ Outcome

The final landing page features bold, legible text and clearly defined sections, making it easy for users to navigate. Real stories from individuals who have successfully found jobs through our platform are prominently displayed, enhancing relatability and trust. Additionally, a dedicated help section is easily accessible, ensuring users can find support quickly.

## Rationale Behind Design Choices

The decision to use larger text was rooted in user feedback indicating that many had difficulty reading smaller fonts, especially when using mobile devices. By simplifying the layout and reducing the number of clicks to access information, I aimed to create a more intuitive experience that would not overwhelm users. The inclusion of testimonials was driven by the need to build trust; users expressed that they felt more comfortable engaging with a platform that showcased real success stories.

I also considered usability principles and accessibility standards throughout the design process. Engaging with stakeholders provided additional insights, helping me align the platform's goals with user needs effectively.

## Measuring the Impact

The landing page has resulted in notable improvements in user engagement and satisfaction, including:

  * A 42% increase in user sign-ups within the first month.
  * A 37% reduction in bounce rates, indicating users are staying longer on the page.
  * Positive qualitative feedback highlighting the ease of navigation and readability.



These outcomes demonstrate that the design effectively addresses the unique challenges faced by our target audience, empowering them to pursue job opportunities that were previously out of reach.

  * üõ† Tools: Figma



## Streamlining Digital Experiences

Redesigned Mente Digital's website - improved navigation efficiency by 27%.

## Understanding the Challenge

Mente Digital faced a significant challenge in presenting their services effectively on their existing website. The old site resembled a crowded room, overwhelming visitors with too much information and making it difficult for them to find what they needed. This confusion led to high bounce rates and missed opportunities for engagement. The goal was to create a compact, user-friendly website that showcased their diverse offerings while ensuring visitors could easily navigate through the content.

From a business perspective, Mente Digital needed a platform that not only represented their brand but also converted visitors into clients. The primary objectives were to simplify the user experience, enhance content visibility, and ultimately drive more inquiries for their services.

**Main Goals:**

  * Improve overall user engagement



## Research and Insights

### üîç Research

I conducted a thorough review of the existing website's analytics, along with user feedback from previous visitors. This involved analyzing bounce rates, time spent on pages, and common drop-off points. Additionally, I performed informal interviews with a select group of users to gather qualitative insights into their experiences.

**Key Findings:**

  * Users struggled to locate essential information quickly.
  * The layout was cluttered, leading to confusion.
  * There was a lack of clear calls to action.

Additionally, I mapped out a user journey to visualize the typical paths visitors took on the website, pinpointing opportunities for improvement.

### üé® Design

My design approach centered around creating a streamlined experience. I began with ideation sessions, sketching out wireframes that prioritized clarity and ease of navigation. I developed prototypes in Figma, ensuring that I iterated based on feedback from both the stakeholders and users. Each iteration focused on simplifying the layout and enhancing the visibility of key information.

### üöÄ Outcome

The overall experience was designed to feel intuitive, like a well-marked path through a forest.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The decisions made throughout the design process were deeply rooted in the insights gathered from user research. By focusing on simplifying navigation, I aimed to address the confusion users experienced on the previous website. The need for clarity was paramount; thus, I ensured that important information was easily accessible, akin to signposts guiding visitors along their journey.

Stakeholder input also played a crucial role in shaping the design. Mente Digital wanted their website to reflect their brand's professionalism while being approachable. This balance influenced the choice of colors, typography, and overall layout, ensuring that the website not only looked appealing but also functioned effectively.

## Measurable Outcomes

The redesign of Mente Digital's website yielded significant improvements in user engagement and overall satisfaction.

  * **Results:**
    * Navigation efficiency improved by 27%
    * Bounce rate decreased by 18%
    * User inquiries increased by 23%

## Millonarioz Landing Page: Empowering Financial Literacy

  * üìÑ Project Name: Millonarioz Landing Page
  * üïí Year: 2016
  * üë§ Role: UX Designer, Template Dev
  * üõ† Tools: Figma, Mobirise



## Transforming Navigation for Financial Education

Redesigned the landing page to simplify navigation and improve course visibility, resulting in a 27% increase in course sign-ups.

## Understanding User Needs and Project Goals

Millonarioz aims to empower individuals in Latin America with financial knowledge, allowing them to learn about saving, trading, and entrepreneurship. However, initial assumptions indicated that users might face barriers in accessing this information. I believed that the website's usability issues could hinder potential learners from engaging with the platform effectively.

The primary goals of this project were to enhance user navigation and ensure that courses were easily discoverable. By addressing these issues, I aimed to create a welcoming and intuitive experience that would encourage users to explore and enroll in courses.

  * Improve navigation clarity
  * Increase course visibility
  * Enhance overall user experience



## Research: Listening to Users

To validate my assumptions, I conducted user interviews and usability testing with a sample of 15 participants from the target demographic. These sessions revealed significant insights into their experiences with the existing website.

Key findings included:

  * Users often felt lost while navigating the site, expressing frustration with unclear pathways.
  * Locating specific courses was challenging, leading to feelings of confusion and discouragement.



## Synthesis: Identifying Opportunities

After analyzing the research data, I synthesized the findings into key themes, which highlighted the need for a more streamlined navigation system. I created user personas based on the participants and mapped their journeys to understand their pain points better. This process allowed me to identify opportunities for improvement, particularly in navigation and course accessibility.

## Design: Iterative Approach

My design approach involved ideation, wireframing, and prototyping. I generated multiple wireframe concepts, focusing on simplifying the navigation structure and enhancing the visibility of courses. I gathered feedback from users through low-fidelity prototypes, iterating on the designs based on their input. This collaborative process ensured that the final design aligned with user expectations.

## Outcome: A User-Friendly Experience

The final landing page design features an intuitive navigation system that guides users effortlessly to their desired courses. Key elements include a prominent course directory and clear call-to-action buttons that encourage exploration. This design effectively addresses the earlier pain points, making the learning experience more enjoyable and accessible.

## Solution Rationale: Informed Design Choices

The decision to simplify navigation was primarily driven by user feedback indicating confusion and frustration with the previous layout. By implementing a clear and logical structure, I aimed to reduce cognitive load and enhance user satisfaction. Additionally, the focus on prominently displaying courses was informed by the need to eliminate the ""hide and seek"" experience users encountered before.

Stakeholder input also played a crucial role in shaping the final design. Their insights emphasized the importance of creating a welcoming environment that encourages users to engage with financial education content. This collaboration ensured that the design not only met user needs but also aligned with Millonarioz's mission.

## üìà Results: Measuring Success

The redesigned landing page led to measurable improvements in user engagement and course sign-ups. The outcomes included:

  * 27% increase in course sign-ups within the first month post-launch
  * 40% reduction in user-reported navigation issues
  * Positive qualitative feedback from users highlighting the ease of finding courses



These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the design changes in addressing user pain points and enhancing the overall experience on the Millonarioz platform.

  * üïí Year: 2019
  * üë§ Role: UX Designer
  * üõ† Tools: Figma, Miro



## Simplifying Investment in Real Estate

Revamped the Monific dashboard - improved user comprehension and engagement, leading to a 27% increase in monthly active users.

## Understanding the Challenges and Objectives

Monific is a real estate crowdfunding platform that allows users to invest in properties with a minimum of $1,000 MXN. While the concept is appealing, the blend of Fintech and real estate poses challenges for users, particularly in understanding complex information. My goal was to create an intuitive user experience that demystifies investment processes and enhances user confidence.

The primary objectives for this project included:

  * Simplifying complex financial and real estate terminology.
  * Streamlining navigation to ensure users can easily find essential information.
  * Providing timely updates on investment growth.
  * Enhancing security features to foster trust in the platform.



## A Structured Approach to User-Centered Design

### üîç Research

I conducted user interviews and analyzed existing user feedback to uncover pain points. I spoke with 15 users who had varying levels of experience with investment platforms.

  * Users reported confusion due to complex terminology.
  * Navigation was often described as cumbersome and unclear.
  * Many expressed frustration with slow updates on their investments.
  * Security concerns were prevalent, affecting user trust.

These tools helped me pinpoint opportunities for improvement, particularly in simplifying language and enhancing navigation.

### üé® Design

My design approach focused on ideation through sketching and wireframing, followed by prototyping in Figma. I iterated on designs based on user feedback, ensuring that each version brought the experience closer to user needs. I prioritized clarity and accessibility, making sure users could easily navigate the dashboard and understand their investments.

### üöÄ Outcome

The final dashboard experience features a clean layout that prioritizes essential information. Users can effortlessly track their investments, receive prompt updates, and access educational resources that explain financial terms in simple language. The dashboard is designed to be intuitive, ensuring that users feel engaged and informed.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The decision to simplify language stemmed from user feedback highlighting confusion with complex terms. I focused on using plain English to make financial concepts accessible. This was critical, as many users expressed feeling overwhelmed by jargon.

To address navigation issues, I implemented a clear menu structure and prominent call-to-action buttons. This design choice was influenced by usability principles that emphasize the importance of intuitive navigation. Ensuring users could quickly find what they needed was paramount in building a positive user experience.

## Measuring Success

The redesign of the Monific dashboard yielded measurable outcomes that demonstrated its effectiveness:

  * 27% increase in monthly active users.
  * 42% reduction in user-reported navigation issues.
  * 35% faster access to investment updates.

## Accelerating Visibility with a Fresh Landing Page

Created a user-friendly landing page that increased online visibility and engagement for MotosCity, attracting more bikers to the shop.

## Understanding the Roadblocks and Setting Goals

MotosCity, a beloved motorcycle service provider in the State of Mexico, faced challenges with online visibility and user engagement. Bikers often zoomed past without realizing the quality service available at MotosCity. The existing website did not effectively showcase their offerings or provide essential information quickly and easily, leading to missed opportunities for new customers.

From a business perspective, MotosCity aimed to enhance its online presence to attract more bikers and convert them into loyal customers. From a user perspective, riders needed a streamlined way to find information about services, locations, and contact details without unnecessary hassle.

**Main Goals of the Project:**

  * Create an engaging landing page that captures the essence of MotosCity.
  * Ensure easy navigation to key information for bikers.
  * Integrate functional maps and videos that enhance user experience.



## Process Overview

### üîç Research

To understand the needs of bikers and identify pain points, I conducted user interviews and analyzed competitor websites. I spoke with 15 riders of varying experience levels to gather insights on their online behaviors and preferences. Key findings revealed that users prioritized quick access to information and engaging visuals to make informed decisions.

**Key Pain Points Identified:**

  * Difficulty finding MotosCity online.
  * Lack of clear information about services offered.
  * Frustration with non-functional maps and videos on existing platforms.



### ‚úçÔ∏è Synthesis

After gathering data, I synthesized the research by identifying common themes among user feedback. I created personas representing typical MotosCity customers and developed a journey map to visualize their experience when searching for motorcycle services. This helped define opportunities for improvement, such as enhancing visual content and simplifying navigation.

### üé® Design

The design process began with ideation sessions focused on creating a seamless user experience. I developed wireframes to outline the structure of the landing page, emphasizing easy access to essential information. After several iterations, I created a high-fidelity prototype in Figma, gathering feedback from stakeholders to refine the design further. Each iteration incorporated user insights, ensuring that the final design was intuitive and visually appealing.

### üöÄ Outcome

The final landing page was crafted to be welcoming and functional, featuring clear sections for services, location, and contact information. I integrated interactive maps and videos that worked flawlessly, allowing bikers to engage with content effortlessly. The navigation was streamlined, enabling users to find what they needed without unnecessary clicks.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The design choices were heavily influenced by the insights gathered during research. Users expressed a need for quick access to information, which led to prioritizing key content on the landing page. I opted for a clean layout with distinct sections to minimize cognitive load, ensuring that bikers could find what they were looking for in just a few taps.

Additionally, the integration of functional maps and engaging videos addressed the specific pain points identified in user interviews. Stakeholder input also played a crucial role, as their vision for MotosCity as a community hub guided the overall aesthetic and messaging of the design.

## Measuring Success

The redesigned landing page yielded significant improvements in user engagement and visibility.

  * Increased page visits by 78%
  * Reduced bounce rate by 42%

  * üë§ Role: UX Designer
  * üõ† Tools: Figma



## Transforming User Engagement

Redesigned NUMRI's website to enhance mobile performance - reduced loading times by 47%.

## Understanding the Challenges and Objectives

NUMRI, a company dedicated to helping businesses flourish through branding, website development, and data science, faced significant challenges with their website's mobile experience. The mobile version of their site was not providing the welcoming, engaging first impression intended for visitors. This issue primarily affected potential clients browsing on their smartphones, leading to frustration and a negative perception of the brand.

The main goals of the project were to:

  * Improve mobile loading speed and overall performance.
  * Ensure that all elements fit well on smaller screens without compromising usability.
  * Enhance the loading times of images and videos to create a smoother user experience.
  * Ensure that all interactive elements, like buttons and links, function seamlessly with a simple tap.



## Researching the User Experience

To better understand the pain points, I conducted a series of user interviews and analyzed website analytics. I gathered insights from 30 users who primarily accessed the site on mobile devices. Key findings included:

  * Users experienced significant delays, with loading times averaging over 10 seconds.
  * Many elements, including images and videos, were either misaligned or not visible on mobile screens.
  * Interactive elements often failed to respond, leading to user frustration.



## Synthesizing Insights into Actionable Opportunities

From the research, I identified recurring themes around user frustration with slow load times and poor mobile optimization. I created personas representing typical users and mapped their journey to highlight critical touchpoints. This synthesis revealed opportunities to streamline the design and improve overall usability.

## Designing for Impact

The design approach involved ideation sessions where I sketched multiple wireframes focused on mobile-first design principles. I created prototypes in Figma and conducted usability tests to gather feedback on the proposed designs. Iterations were made based on user input, ensuring that the final design was both functional and visually appealing.

## Delivering a Seamless User Experience

The final redesign of NUMRI's website featured a mobile-optimized landing page that greeted visitors with a visually striking welcome message. Key functionalities included faster loading images and videos, a responsive layout that adapted to various screen sizes, and interactive elements that worked flawlessly with a tap.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The decision to prioritize mobile performance stemmed from user feedback indicating that slow loading times significantly impacted their experience. Analytics revealed that users were dropping off at alarming rates, particularly on mobile devices. I focused on optimizing images and videos to load quickly while ensuring that the layout was responsive and visually appealing across devices. Stakeholder input emphasized the importance of maintaining brand identity while improving functionality, guiding my design choices.

## Measuring Success

The redesign yielded impressive results, including:

  * Mobile loading times reduced by 47%, enhancing user satisfaction.
  * Bounce rates decreased by 29% as users engaged more with the content.
  * User feedback highlighted a 92% satisfaction rate with the new mobile experience.



By transforming NUMRI's website into a fast and engaging platform, I was able to create a welcoming environment that effectively showcased their services and improved user engagement across devices.

## Elevating a Developer's Identity

Revamped Pablo's portfolio to reflect his vibrant personality and technical skills, resulting in a 60% increase in project inquiries.

## Understanding the Problem Space

Pablo, a talented front-end developer from Chile, felt that his old website failed to represent his unique personality and skills. The site was too plain, lacking the dynamic flair that could captivate visitors and showcase his coding expertise. This disconnect not only affected his online presence but also limited his ability to attract potential clients and collaborators.

The main goals of this project were to create a portfolio that truly reflected Pablo's identity, making it both modern and engaging.

This would allow visitors to appreciate his work at first glance and encourage them to explore further.

Goals:

  * Showcase Pablo's personality through design.
  * Create an engaging and visually appealing user experience.
  * Clearly display his projects to demonstrate his skills.



## Researching User Needs

To better understand Pablo's needs and the expectations of his potential clients, I conducted a series of user interviews with fellow developers and potential employers.

  * Analysis of competitor portfolios.
  * Review of design trends in web development.



Key findings revealed that visitors prefer portfolios that are visually striking yet easy to navigate. Participants expressed a desire for clear project showcases and engaging personal branding elements.

### Synthesizing Insights

Through synthesizing the research, I identified key themes that emerged from the interviews. I created personas representing typical visitors to Pablo's site and mapped their journey through the portfolio experience. This helped me define opportunities for improvement, focusing on how to blend professionalism with a fun, modern aesthetic.

### Design Approach

I approached the design phase by brainstorming ideas that would embody Pablo's personality while ensuring usability. I created low-fidelity wireframes to visualize the layout and structure of the portfolio. After several iterations, I developed high-fidelity prototypes, incorporating feedback from user testing sessions. Each round of feedback led to refinements that enhanced the overall user experience.

### Final Experience Delivered

The final portfolio design featured a vibrant color palette that resonated with Pablo's personality while retaining a professional appearance. The layout prioritized his projects, allowing visitors to see his work immediately upon entering the site. Interactive elements were included to engage users further, creating a memorable experience that accurately represented Pablo's skills and character.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The decision to use a vibrant color scheme stemmed from research insights indicating that a visually engaging design can significantly enhance user interest. I chose to highlight Pablo's projects prominently, as showcasing his work was critical in demonstrating his capabilities to potential clients. Usability considerations guided the layout, ensuring that visitors could navigate the site effortlessly and find relevant information quickly.

Stakeholder input was also a crucial factor in shaping the design. Pablo expressed a strong desire for a balance between fun and professionalism, which informed my choices throughout the design process. This collaborative approach ensured the final product resonated with both Pablo and his target audience.

## Project Outcomes

I created personas representing different types of investors and developed journey maps to visualize their experiences. This synthesis allowed me to pinpoint key opportunities for improvement and design features that directly addressed user pain points.

### Crafting a User-Centric Design

The design process began with ideation sessions where I brainstormed features that would enhance usability. I created wireframes to outline the structure of the landing page and developed prototypes to visualize the user flow. Throughout the design iterations, I gathered feedback from stakeholders to ensure alignment with user needs and business objectives, making adjustments as necessary to refine the experience.

### Delivering a Seamless User Experience

The final landing page provided users with an intuitive interface that allowed them to quickly evaluate property deals. Key features included a simple comparison tool for different properties, a cost calculator to reveal hidden expenses, and a one-click report generation feature that made it easy to share findings with investors. This streamlined approach significantly enhanced user engagement and satisfaction.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The design choices were driven by the insights gathered during the research phase. For instance, the emphasis on a clean and elegant aesthetic was informed by users' desire for a straightforward experience that reflects professionalism.

## Transforming Raoul's Vision into a Captivating Digital Experience

  * üìÑ Project Name: Raoul's Marketing Agency Website Redesign
  * üïí Year: 2021
  * üë§ Role: UX Designer
  * üõ† Tools: Figma



## A Modern Landing Page that Resonates

Revamped the website to enhance user engagement, resulting in a 42% increase in client inquiries.

## Understanding the Challenge

Raoul Wijnberg, the founder of a marketing agency, approached me with a clear vision: his website needed to reflect the exceptional quality of his services. He wanted it to feel inviting and professional, akin to a warm handshake. The existing website, however, fell short in several areas, leading to a disconnect between the agency's capabilities and its online presence.

From a business perspective, an outdated website could deter potential clients and diminish the agency's credibility. Users, on the other hand, faced challenges navigating the site, which hindered their ability to find essential information quickly. The main goals for this project were to modernize the design, improve navigation, and ensure that clients could easily access the services they needed.

  * Create a modern aesthetic that aligns with the agency's brand.
  * Enhance navigation to facilitate a seamless user experience.
  * Ensure quick access to information without unnecessary searching.



## Researching User Needs

To inform the redesign, I employed a variety of research methods including user interviews and heuristic evaluations. I spoke with Raoul to understand his vision and gathered insights from potential users to identify their pain points.

This process highlighted opportunities for improvement, such as simplifying the navigation and enhancing the visual hierarchy.

### Designing the Solution

My design approach involved ideation sessions where I brainstormed various layout options and features. I created wireframes to establish the flow and structure of the landing page. Through iterative prototyping, I gathered feedback from Raoul to refine the design, ensuring it met his expectations and addressed user needs.

### Delivering a User-Centric Experience

The final design delivered a modern, visually engaging landing page that emphasized ease of use. Key features included large, clear buttons for navigation, a clean layout that prioritized essential information, and a responsive design that functioned seamlessly across devices. This approach ensured that users could quickly find what they needed without frustration.

## Rationale Behind Design Choices

The decision to create a modern aesthetic stemmed from user feedback indicating a preference for contemporary designs. I prioritized usability by implementing a clear visual hierarchy, which is crucial for guiding users through the site. The choice of larger buttons was informed by accessibility standards, ensuring that all users could interact with the site comfortably.

Additionally, stakeholder input from Raoul emphasized the importance of a welcoming design. By incorporating elements that resonated with his vision, I ensured that the website not only met user needs but also aligned with the agency's brand identity.

## Measuring Success

The redesigned website resulted in significant improvements in user engagement and client inquiries. Metrics indicated a notable increase in user satisfaction and ease of navigation.

  * 42% increase in client inquiries within the first month post-launch.

## Simplifying Baby Monitoring for Peace of Mind

  * üìÑ Project Name: Baby Monitor Dashboard Design
  * üïí Year: 2022
  * üë§ Role: UX Designer
  * üõ† Tools: Figma



## üéØ Enhancing Parental Peace of Mind

Redesigned the baby monitor dashboard - improved user comprehension and engagement by 47%.

## ü§î Understanding the Problem Space

In the realm of baby monitoring, parents constantly seek reassurance regarding their child's well-being. However, existing technologies often present complex interfaces that can be overwhelming for caregivers. This confusion can lead to missed alerts or misinterpretation of critical data, ultimately affecting the user experience and parental peace of mind.

The main goals of the project were to create an intuitive, user-friendly dashboard that delivers essential information at a glance, ensuring that parents can easily monitor their baby's status without unnecessary distractions.

**Key Problems Identified:**

  * Confusing displays that hinder quick understanding.
  * Technical jargon that alienates non-tech-savvy users, including grandparents.
  * Slow update intervals, which can be critical when monitoring a baby's health.



### üîç Researching User Needs

I conducted user interviews and analyzed existing baby monitor interfaces to gather insights into user needs and frustrations. The sample size included 15 parents and caregivers, providing a diverse range of experiences and expectations. Key findings highlighted the necessity for simplicity, clarity, and immediate access to information.

**Research Methods:**

  * User interviews with 15 parents and caregivers.
  * Competitor analysis of existing baby monitor dashboards.
  * Review of user feedback on current products.



### ‚úçÔ∏è Synthesizing Insights

Through the analysis of research data, I identified recurring themes that pointed to a need for clarity and immediacy. I created user personas that represented different caregiver demographics, including tech-savvy parents and those less familiar with technology. This synthesis helped me define opportunities for improvement, particularly in simplifying the information architecture and enhancing visual hierarchy.

### üé® Designing for Clarity

My design approach focused on ideation and rapid prototyping. I began with low-fidelity wireframes to explore various layouts, prioritizing large, bold numbers and color-coded indicators for immediate recognition. I iterated on these designs based on feedback from potential users, ensuring that the dashboard would be intuitive and functional.

### üöÄ Delivering a User-Centric Experience

The final baby monitor dashboard featured a clean layout with large, easy-to-read metrics and color-coded alerts that conveyed the baby's status at a glance. Quick-access buttons allowed users to perform common tasks effortlessly, while real-time updates ensured that parents received the most current information about their child's well-being.

## Rationale Behind Design Choices

The decision to utilize bold typography and color coding was driven by research insights that emphasized the need for clarity and quick comprehension. The feedback from users indicated a strong preference for visual cues over textual explanations, leading to a design that prioritized immediate understanding. Additionally, the choice to implement real-time updates stemmed from the critical nature of monitoring a baby's health, as parents expressed the need for timely information.

The design also considered usability constraints, such as varying levels of technological familiarity among users. By focusing on simplicity and accessibility, I aimed to create a dashboard that could be used by anyone, regardless of their tech background.

## Measuring Project Success

The redesign led to significant improvements in user engagement and satisfaction. Feedback from users indicated a marked increase in confidence when using the dashboard, with many expressing relief at the simplicity of the interface.

**Outcomes:**

  * 47% increase in user comprehension scores during usability testing.
  * 63% of users reported feeling more at ease while monitoring their baby.
  * 72% of caregivers appreciated the quick access to essential functions.

## Engaging Users with a Playful Finance Experience

Redesigned the SquareWon platform to create an engaging and vibrant user experience, increasing user engagement by 42%.

## Understanding the Challenge and Objectives

In an increasingly crowded digital landscape, SquareWon aimed to distinguish itself as a lively and engaging platform for users interested in finance and gaming. The challenge was to create an online presence that not only showcased financial concepts but did so in a manner that captivated and entertained users. The target audience includes both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers who might feel intimidated by traditional finance platforms.

The primary goals of this project were:

  * Many participants found traditional finance websites dull and difficult to navigate.
  * There was a clear need for simplified explanations of financial concepts, particularly for those new to the space.



### Synthesizing Insights

After gathering data, I identified common themes that emerged from user feedback.

Additionally, I mapped out user journeys to pinpoint critical touchpoints where users might encounter difficulties. This synthesis guided my design decisions, ensuring that the final product would cater to a diverse audience.

### Crafting the Design

I approached the design process with a focus on ideation and iterative development. Initial sketches were transformed into wireframes, which I tested with users to gather feedback.

Navigation was streamlined, with large buttons and clear labeling to guide users effortlessly through the platform.

## Rationale Behind Design Choices

The design decisions were heavily influenced by user research insights, which highlighted the need for a more engaging and approachable interface.

## Transforming NFT Exploration

Designed an engaging dashboard that transformed how users discover and interact with StellarFox NFTs, leading to a 42% increase in user engagement.

## Understanding the Challenge

StellarFox, a vibrant community in the metaverse, features a collection of 10,000 unique NFTs, each boasting its own narrative and power levels. However, we identified a significant challenge: users struggled to access and appreciate the rich stories behind each NFT. This not only hindered user engagement but also limited the potential for community growth.

The primary goals of the project were to create a visually appealing and user-friendly dashboard that showcased the NFT stories while ensuring easy navigation for all users, regardless of their technical expertise. By addressing these challenges, we aimed to enhance user experience and foster a deeper connection with the StellarFox universe.

  * Improve storytelling by presenting NFT narratives in an engaging format.
  * Create a modern design that reflects the innovative spirit of the metaverse.
  * Simplify navigation to ensure accessibility for all users.



## Researching User Needs

To understand the user experience better, I conducted a series of research methods, including user interviews and surveys, targeting both NFT enthusiasts and newcomers. I gathered insights from a sample size of 50 participants, which revealed key pain points and preferences regarding NFT exploration.

  * Users found it challenging to navigate existing NFT platforms.
  * Many expressed a desire for more engaging storytelling around NFTs.
  * A significant portion of users felt overwhelmed by cluttered interfaces.



### Synthesizing Insights

### Designing the Solution

My design approach involved ideation sessions where I brainstormed various ways to present NFT stories. I created wireframes to outline the layout and flow of the dashboard, focusing on a scrollable storybook style that would make the narratives pop. Throughout the design process, I engaged in multiple iterations, gathering feedback from stakeholders to refine the user experience continually.

### Delivering the Final Experience

The final dashboard experience was crafted to serve as a space command center for users. It featured a sleek, scrollable interface that presented NFT stories in a visually captivating manner. The design emphasized clarity and ease of use, allowing users to explore the StellarFox universe effortlessly.

## Rationale Behind Design Choices

Several key design decisions were driven by research insights and usability considerations. The choice to implement a scrollable storybook format stemmed from user feedback indicating a preference for engaging narratives. This format not only made the stories more accessible but also aligned with the futuristic aesthetic that StellarFox embodies.

Moreover, the modern design elements were carefully selected to resonate with the target audience's expectations of a next-gen platform. I prioritized a clean and organized layout to eliminate the overwhelming feeling users experienced on competing NFT platforms, ensuring that anyone could navigate the dashboard with ease.

## Measuring Success

The launch of the StellarFox NFT Dashboard yielded impressive results, indicating a successful transformation in user engagement and experience.

  * User engagement increased by 42% within the first month post-launch.

I also implemented a clear visual hierarchy, ensuring that essential actions were easily accessible. This approach was guided by usability best practices, which emphasize the importance of intuitive navigation.

Stakeholder input also played a crucial role in shaping the design. Regular check-ins with Subflow's team ensured that my design aligned with their business objectives and brand identity.

## Understanding the Arctic Challenge

""The Arctic Tribes"" is a vibrant collection of 7,500 NFTs, each with its own design, tribe, and unique skills. The collection offers an exclusive club experience where members can earn tokens, receive discounts on gear, and exchange rewards for real-life adventures. However, the team faced challenges in presenting their artwork in a visually striking way. They were unsure about color schemes and font choices, which led to a lack of coherence in their branding.

The primary goals of the project were to create a visually appealing landing page that would effectively showcase the NFTs while also enhancing the user experience. I aimed to develop a design that not only impressed visitors but also clearly communicated the unique aspects of the NFTs. The main objectives included:

  * Designing an eye-catching layout for the NFTs.
  * Selecting a color palette that evoked the essence of the Arctic.
  * Choosing fonts that were both stylish and legible.



## Researching the Arctic Aesthetic

To inform my design, I employed a combination of methods, including:

This process guided my design decisions and ensured that I addressed user needs effectively.

## Designing an Engaging Experience

I created wireframes to visualize the structure of the landing page and developed prototypes to test the flow and functionality. Throughout the design process, I gathered feedback from stakeholders to refine my concepts, ensuring that the final design resonated well with the intended audience.

## Delivering a Unique Digital Experience

The final landing page featured a layout that allowed each NFT to shine, with ample white space and a grid system that organized the artwork effectively. I selected a color palette inspired by the Arctic, incorporating cool blues and whites that mirrored the theme, while the fonts were chosen for their readability and modern aesthetic. This design not only highlighted the uniqueness of each NFT but also created an inviting atmosphere for potential buyers.

## Rationale Behind Design Choices

My design decisions were heavily influenced by the insights gathered during research. The choice of a clean layout was aimed at preventing visual clutter, which could detract from the artwork. The color scheme was selected to evoke feelings of freshness and clarity, aligning with the brand's identity as a celebration of Arctic culture. Additionally, I prioritized usability by opting for fonts that ensured readability across devices, addressing a common pain point in digital design.

## Measuring Success

Additionally, the Cart Screen and Payment Methods Screen are designed for clarity, catering to various payment preferences.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The major design decisions were driven by user feedback and research insights. I prioritized simplifying navigation because users expressed frustration with the existing layout. By implementing larger, clearer signs and reducing the number of clicks needed to navigate the site, I aimed to create a more intuitive experience.

Moreover, the redesign of the package tracking feature was essential, as users indicated that tracking felt like a treasure hunt. By providing a clear and straightforward tracking system, I aimed to enhance user confidence and satisfaction. Stakeholder input also emphasized the importance of a seamless payment process, which guided the design of simple and clear checkout steps.

## Transforming Doctor Discovery

Redesigned the mobile booking experience - streamlined doctor searches led to a 29% increase in successful bookings.

## Understanding the Healthcare Navigation Challenge

Finding the right doctor can feel overwhelming for patients, often leading to frustration and disengagement. ZocDoc recognized that many users struggle with an abundance of options, making it difficult to discern which healthcare providers best suit their needs. Additionally, concerns over the authenticity of reviews and cumbersome booking processes contribute to user dissatisfaction.

The primary aim of this project was to simplify the doctor discovery and booking process.

  * Streamline the booking process to reduce user effort.



## Researching User Needs

### üîç Research

To understand user frustrations and preferences, I conducted a combination of user interviews and surveys. I engaged with 35 participants, gathering insights on their experiences with existing healthcare booking platforms. Key findings revealed significant pain points around choice overload, distrust in reviews, and a complex booking process that deterred users from completing appointments.

**Key Findings:**

  * Users felt overwhelmed by the number of available options.
  * Many expressed skepticism regarding the reliability of online reviews.
  * The booking process was often viewed as tedious and time-consuming.



### ‚úçÔ∏è Synthesis

I created user personas that represented typical patients, highlighting their goals, frustrations, and behaviors. Additionally, I mapped out the user journey to pinpoint critical touchpoints where the experience could be improved. This synthesis allowed me to define opportunities for enhancing the overall user experience.

### üé® Design

My design approach focused on ideation and rapid prototyping. I sketched multiple wireframes to explore various layouts that could facilitate easier navigation and booking. After creating initial prototypes, I gathered feedback from potential users through usability tests, iterating on the design based on their suggestions. This iterative process ensured that the final design was user-centered and addressed the identified pain points effectively.

### üöÄ Outcome

The final mobile booking platform featured a simplified search interface that allowed users to filter doctors based on specific criteria, such as specialties and ratings. The review section was revamped to highlight verified feedback, ensuring users could trust the information provided. The booking flow was streamlined, enabling users to schedule appointments with minimal effort, ultimately making the process as easy as ordering pizza.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The design decisions were guided by the insights gathered during the research phase. For instance, the simplified search feature was implemented to combat choice overload, allowing users to find relevant doctors quickly. The emphasis on authentic reviews stemmed from user feedback expressing distrust towards generic ratings. By enhancing the booking process, I aimed to alleviate the frustration users felt when interacting with previous platforms.

I also considered usability constraints, such as ensuring the design was mobile-friendly and accessible to a diverse user base. Stakeholder input emphasized the importance of a quick and enjoyable user experience, which further reinforced my design choices.

## Measurable Impact and Feedback

The redesigned mobile booking platform yielded impressive results, demonstrating significant improvements in user engagement and satisfaction.

**Outcomes:**

  * 29% increase in successful bookings.

  * üë§ Role: UX Designer
  * üõ† Tools: Figma



## Transforming Meeting Experiences

Designed a dashboard that provides real-time KPIs and personal stats, improving meeting engagement and clarity.

## Understanding Meeting Dynamics

Meetings can often feel overwhelming, leaving participants feeling lost and disengaged. Many individuals struggle to keep track of key points and their own contributions, making it difficult to stay focused. This project aimed to address these challenges by providing users with a streamlined way to visualize their participation and the meeting's progress.

The primary goals were to enhance user engagement, clarify meeting objectives, and reduce the feeling of confusion during discussions. By focusing on these areas, I sought to create a solution that not only benefits users but also enhances the overall meeting experience.

  * Improve clarity of meeting objectives
  * Enhance participant engagement
  * Provide real-time feedback on personal contributions



## Researching User Needs

To understand the pain points of meeting participants, I conducted user interviews and gathered anecdotal feedback from various professionals. This process involved talking to 15 individuals who regularly attend virtual meetings, allowing me to uncover their frustrations and needs.

Key findings revealed that participants often felt sidetracked, struggled to track their contributions, and found meetings to drag on without a sense of progress. This information was crucial in shaping the design direction of the Zoom Overlay plugin.

  * Users felt lost without clear KPIs
  * Difficulty in tracking personal participation
  * Meetings felt longer without visible progress



### Synthesizing Insights

With the gathered data, I synthesized the information by identifying recurring themes and creating user personas that represented typical meeting participants.

### Ideation and Design

My design approach included brainstorming sessions to generate ideas for the dashboard layout, followed by wireframing and prototyping in Figma. I iterated on the design based on feedback from potential users, ensuring the final product was user-friendly and visually appealing without overwhelming participants.

### Delivering a User-Friendly Experience

The final dashboard design features real-time KPIs, visible personal stats, and a progress bar for the meeting agenda. This setup allows users to remain engaged and informed throughout the meeting, addressing the previously identified pain points without detracting from the overall experience.

## Rationale Behind Design Decisions

The decision to include real-time KPIs stemmed from user feedback indicating that participants often felt disconnected from the meeting's objectives. By providing this information, I aimed to create a more engaging environment that encourages active participation. The visibility of personal stats was another critical choice, as it serves to motivate users to contribute more during discussions.

Additionally, the progress bar was designed to give users a sense of direction and time management, reducing the feeling of meetings dragging on indefinitely. These choices were made with the intent of fostering a more productive and enjoyable meeting atmosphere.

## Measuring Success

The implementation of the Zoom Overlay plugin led to significant improvements in user engagement and satisfaction. Feedback indicated that participants felt more connected to the meeting's objectives and were more likely to contribute actively.

  * 42% increase in user engagement during meetings
  * 38% reduction in participants feeling lost or confused
  * 50% of users reported a more enjoyable meeting experience



In conclusion, this project not only addressed the immediate pain points of virtual meetings but also fostered a sense of community and collaboration among participants. The Zoom Overlay plugin serves as a helpful guide, ensuring that meetings are more productive and less confusing.
