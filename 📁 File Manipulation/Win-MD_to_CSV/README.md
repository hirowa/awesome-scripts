## Markdown to CSV Converter
### Script Overview
This Python script automates the process of scanning a specified directory for Markdown (`.md`) files and extracting their contents into a single CSV file. Each Markdown file is converted into a row in the CSV file, with the filename and its text content (newline characters replaced by spaces) stored as columns. This is particularly useful for batch-processing documentation or notes into a format suitable for analysis, search indexing, or backup purposes.

### Detailed Use/Features
- **User Input for Directory**: The script prompts the user to enter the path to the folder that contains the `.md` files.
- **Directory Validation**: It validates the provided path to ensure it's a valid directory.
- **Markdown File Detection**: It scans the directory for files ending in `.md`.
- **CSV Generation**: A new file named `markdown_files.csv` is created in the same directory.
- **Content Extraction**: Each Markdown file is opened and read, with its newline characters replaced by spaces to fit into a single CSV cell.
- **CSV Output**: The final CSV includes two columns: `Filename` and `Content`.

### Installation
