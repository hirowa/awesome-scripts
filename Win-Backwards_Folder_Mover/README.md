## Backwards Folder Mover
### Script Overview
This script is designed to automate the process of reorganizing the directory structure by moving all files and subfolders up one level and then deleting the original folder. This is particularly useful for flattening nested directory structures, making files more accessible, or cleaning up a directory tree by removing unnecessary folders.

### Detailed Use
1. **Directory Traversal**: The script starts at the specified root directory (the current working directory by default) and traverses through all subdirectories.
2. **Moving Files and Folders**: For each subdirectory, it moves all files and subfolders up one level to the parent directory.
3. **Deleting Empty Folders**: After moving all contents of a folder, the script deletes the now-empty folder.
4. **Logging**: The script prints a log of all files moved and folders deleted to provide a clear trace of its actions.

### Installation
#### Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- **shutil** and **os** are part of Python's standard library, so no additional installations are required.

#### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system (version 3.6 or higher).
3. No additional dependencies need to be installed as all required modules are part of Python's standard library.

#### Usage
1. Place the script in the root directory from which you want to start reorganizing files.
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```
3. The script will recursively move all files and folders in subdirectories up one level and delete the emptied subdirectories.
