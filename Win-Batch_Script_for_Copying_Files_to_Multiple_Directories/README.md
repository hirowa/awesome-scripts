## Batch Script for Copying Files to Multiple Directories

### Script Overview
This collection of batch scripts is designed to automate the process of copying a specified file into multiple directories. These scripts can copy a file to all subfolders in a specified directory, optionally including deeper subfolder levels. They are particularly useful for administrative tasks that require duplicating files across multiple locations.

### Detailed Use/Features
1. **Copy File to Direct Subfolders Only**:
   - The first script copies a specified file into every direct subfolder of a specified directory.
   - Users need to modify the script to specify the path to the target folder and the file they wish to copy.
   
   ```batch
   @echo off
   for /D %%a in ("path-to-folder\*.*") do xcopy /y /d path-to-file\file.FileExt "%%a\"
   ```
   - `for /D %%a in ("path-to-folder\*.*")` iterates over each directory in the specified path.
   - `xcopy /y /d path-to-file\file.FileExt "%%a\"` copies the specified file into each subfolder.

2. **Copy File to All Subfolders (One Level)**:
   - The second script copies a file (`GridCreator.bat`) to all subfolders within the current working directory but does not traverse into their sub-subfolders.
   - This script is run directly from the terminal.
   
   ```batch
   @echo off
   for /r /d %%I in (*) do xcopy "GridCreator.bat" "%%~fsI" /H /K
   ```
   - `for /r /d %%I in (*)` iterates recursively through all directories starting from the current directory.
   - `xcopy "GridCreator.bat" "%%~fsI" /H /K` copies the file into each subfolder.

3. **Copy File to All Subfolders and Sub-Subfolders**:
   - This script copies a file (`water.txt`) to all subfolders and their respective subfolders within the current directory.
   - Written in Bash, this script is suitable for Unix-based systems (Linux or macOS).
   
   ```bash
   for i in ./* # iterate over all files in current dir
   do
       if [ -d "$i" ] # if it's a directory
       then
           cp water.txt "$i" # copy water.txt into it
       fi
   done
   ```
   - `for i in ./*` loops through all files and directories in the current directory.
   - `if [ -d "$i" ]` checks if the current item is a directory.
   - `cp water.txt "$i"` copies the file `water.txt` into each subfolder.

### Installation
#### Requirements
- Windows OS (for batch scripts) or Unix-based OS (for the Bash script).
- Administrator or necessary file permissions to write into directories.

#### Installation Steps
1. **Download or Create the Scripts**:
   - Copy the script code into a new text file.
   - Save the file with a `.bat` extension for Windows batch scripts or `.sh` for the Unix-based shell script.

2. **Modify the Script**:
   - Replace `"path-to-folder"` with the actual path to your target directory.
   - Replace `"path-to-file\file.FileExt"` with the path and filename of the file you wish to copy.
   - For the Bash script, ensure the file `water.txt` is in the same directory as the script or provide an absolute path.

3. **Run the Script**:
   - On Windows: Double-click the `.bat` file or run it from the Command Prompt.
   - On Unix-based systems: Open a terminal, navigate to the script's location, and run it using `bash scriptname.sh` or `./scriptname.sh` (ensure executable permissions with `chmod +x scriptname.sh`).

#### Usage
1. Place the script in the appropriate directory.
2. Execute the script according to the operating system instructions.
3. Monitor the terminal or command prompt for any errors or confirmation messages indicating the script's actions.
