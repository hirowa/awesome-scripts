## Batch Executor for Nested `.bat` Files

### Script Overview
This batch script is designed to locate and execute all `.bat` files within a specified root directory and its subfolders. It automates the execution process by iterating through the directory tree, changing to the respective directory of each `.bat` file, and running the file. The script ensures that all `.bat` files are called sequentially without manual intervention.

### Detailed Use/Features
1. **Recursive Search**: The script uses the `FOR /R` loop to recursively search for all `.bat` files starting from a specified root directory.
2. **Directory Context Switching**: Before executing each `.bat` file, the script changes the current working directory to the directory containing the `.bat` file to ensure proper execution.
3. **Sequential Execution**: All `.bat` files found are executed in the order they are discovered.
4. **Execution Log**: The script displays a start message (`@echo start`) and pauses at the end to allow users to review the results of the execution.

### Installation

#### Requirements
- Windows operating system with Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`) support.
- Administrative privileges may be required to execute certain `.bat` files, depending on their content.

#### Installation Steps
1. Create a new `.bat` file in your desired location (e.g., `execute_nested_bats.bat`).
2. Copy and paste the following script into the `.bat` file:
   ```bat
   @echo start
   for /r "C:\Path\To\Root\Directory" %%a in (*.bat) do (
      cd "%%~pa"
      call "%%~a"
   )
   pause
   ```
3. Replace `"C:\Path\To\Root\Directory"` with the root directory path where your `.bat` files are located.

#### Usage
1. Ensure that all `.bat` files to be executed are in subfolders under the specified root directory.
2. Double-click the script (`execute_nested_bats.bat`) to run it.
3. The script will:
   - Locate all `.bat` files within the root directory and its subdirectories.
   - Change to the directory of each `.bat` file and execute it using the `call` command.
4. After all `.bat` files have been executed, the script will pause, allowing you to review any output or messages in the Command Prompt.
