## AI Course Notes Generator
### Script Overview
This script automates the summarization and note-taking process for university degree program materials from PDF files. It extracts text from PDF documents, sends the extracted text to the OpenAI API for summarization, and saves the generated summaries as text files. This script is particularly useful for students, educators, and researchers who need to condense large volumes of academic material into concise summaries.

### Detailed Use
1. **PDF to Text Conversion**: The script scans a specified directory, identifies all PDF files, and converts their content to plain text using the PyMuPDF library (`fitz`).
2. **API Communication**: The extracted text is sent to the OpenAI API for summarization. The script constructs a request with predefined parameters (model, temperature, max tokens, etc.) and handles the API response to retrieve the generated summaries.
3. **Result Storage**: Summaries generated by the API are saved as new text files in the same directory as the original PDFs, with filenames indicating they contain AI-generated summaries.
4. **Error Handling and Rate Limiting**: The script includes error handling for both PDF conversion and API communication and implements a delay to prevent exceeding API rate limits.

### Installation
#### Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- **PyMuPDF (fitz)** for PDF processing
- **requests** library for handling HTTP requests

#### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install PyMuPDF requests
   ```
3. Set Up Your OpenAI API Key and Prompt:
    Replace <put_your_api_key_here> in the script with your actual OpenAI API key.
    Replace <put_prompt_here> in the DATA_TEMPLATE dictionary with your desired prompt. This prompt will instruct the AI on how to summarize the content.

#### Usage
- Place the PDF files to be summarized in a directory.
- Run the script using Python:
  ```bash
  python your_script_name.py
  ```
- The script will process all PDFs in the specified directory and save the summarized content as text files in the same location.
