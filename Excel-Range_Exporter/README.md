## Excel Range Exporter

### Script Overview
This VBA script, `ExportRangetoFile`, is designed to export a selected range of cells from an Excel worksheet to a new text file. It is particularly useful for users who frequently need to save specific data ranges from Excel into a text format for further analysis or sharing purposes.

### Detailed Use/Features
1. **Range Selection**: 
   - If only one cell is selected, the script prompts the user to manually select a range using an input box.
   - If a range is already selected, it uses the currently selected range.
   
2. **Error Handling**:
   - If no range is selected or the selection is canceled, a message box is displayed, and the script exits.
   
3. **File Export**:
   - The script creates a new workbook and copies the selected range into this new workbook.
   - It then prompts the user to save the newly created workbook as a text file through a "Save As" dialog.
   - The file is saved in `.txt` format.

4. **Workbook Management**:
   - After saving the text file, the newly created workbook is closed without saving changes (as the file has already been exported).
   
5. **Screen and Alert Management**:
   - Screen updating and display alerts are temporarily turned off during the script's execution to enhance performance and avoid unnecessary prompts. These settings are restored at the end of the script.
